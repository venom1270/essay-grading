5978	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.  	1	1	1
5979	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, "brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, "The sun was beginning to beat down"(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. " and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June"(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town' but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."	2	2	2
5980	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven't been out in ages. The old men apparently haven't been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions.  My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. "Yes, sir!	1	1	1
5981	3	I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn't of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of him so he took the shortcut. After his experence he new haes to stat ?? to the mep and not trust people who havent seen changes in the last few years.  	1	1	1
5982	3	The setting effects the cyclist because of the setting were diffrent the story would not of made sense. The setting of the story is not and dry with scaterd ghost towns. When he reaches the first "town" he sees "One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule." If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, "In the story the speeker says "I was travling through the high deserts of California" that are very hot and dry, and he says "This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn't have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting.	2	2	2
5983	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.  	1	1	1
5984	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert. In conclusion the desert is hot.	1	1	1
5985	3	The affects of the cyclist is if it does not change. it cut hurt a lot of people feeling because they @CAPS1 don't care about the cyclist. I'm one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them @CAPS1 blow stuff up. They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don't believe to I see it. That @CAPS1 not for black people because it has not did anything to us. We really don't care about the affects of the cyclist.	0	0	0
5986	3	The essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" describes a man's bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man's journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips." As you can see the setting makes this man's bikeride very hard.	2	2	2
5987	3	"In the story, "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, "the sun was beginning to beat down." @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain's a person's energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; "The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie's story, "Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  "	2	3	3
5988	3	The setting of the authors " shortcut" effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well." Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills." The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views." I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill." The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, " success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts." I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3	2	3
5989	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the hot desert. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. If he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. This is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so. 	1	1	1
5990	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. "I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." That shows he wasn't prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. "Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke."	3	2	3
5991	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.	1	2	2
5992	3	The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as "flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."	1	1	1
5993	3	In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because of he sees the same setting (the dessert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint.	1	2	2
5994	3	Many different characteristics in a setting and determine the outcome of an event there. Im the story, Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclists journey was affected my a few weather relouded things. The heat was an extreme thing that showed him down and in most cases detened him from reading his maximum level of ability. Also the time of your in which this labes place, greatly affects the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as they life	2	2	2
5995	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting.	2	2	2
5996	3	In the story "Rough Road Ahead" by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states "I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you.	1	1	1
5997	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, "a tarlike substance oozed out" of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to "short, rolling hills", which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake", slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2	2
5998	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that's not empty or almost empty like a "ghost town" as the cyclist said.	2	1	2
5999	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1	1
6000	3	"Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he'd once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn't ever take shortcuts again	2	2	2
6001	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn't travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1	1
6002	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, "somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2	2
6003	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men's help, and doesn't seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next "town" he hits doesn't have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn't further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.	3	3	3
6004	3	Well I would put it like this is that the weather had everything to do with it because the not weather make you tired and upset and easy to angre so now it make you upset and and then stress.	1	1	1
6005	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it's you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks "dehydration" and "death." If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3	2	3
6006	3	The settings of the story were grveling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him. The cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, sweat, and dehydration. The California desert is a grveling place to be, especially in June. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, before he would eventually continue his way to Yosemite National Park	2	2	2
6007	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don't know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions.	2	3	3
6008	3	The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 ‘because ‘ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects.	1	1	1
6010	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.   	1	1	1
6011	3	In the essay the mshan writes of rough rodes timit the cyclist's had to overcome to reach @CAPS1 gole.	1	1	1
6012	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason's how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it's more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That's why they chase the mode.  	0	0	0
6013	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated which could lead to a heatstroke. "I could drop from a heatstroke" this shows that it was hot out and he was feeling bad if he could have dropped from a heatstroke.	1	1	1
6014	3	"The terrain during the cyclist's journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, "I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, "sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did. "	3	2	3
6015	3	The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn't take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time.	2	2	2
6016	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren't to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men's story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story.	3	2	3
6017	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1	1
6018	3	The features of the settings affect in the story "Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit" it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2	2
6019	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1	1
6020	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, "no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, "The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips." He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, " one long, crippling hill." The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.	2	2	2
6021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	1	2	2
6022	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited." @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6023	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like "battery acid," his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most.	2	2	2
6024	3	In the story of "rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit" the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives but the heat and the season he was riding he'll probably bring another water botlle nextime	1	1	1
6025	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. Also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills	1	1	1
6026	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. "I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. "This sight was troubling" when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. "At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake" He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1's factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait." He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3	3
6027	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In "Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit" the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how "The sun was beginning to beat down" expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their "shortcut." Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with "one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest male." @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a "battery-acid" flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he "had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait." His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn't even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3	3	3
6028	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." All the road was hills and rough. Than "The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips." @CAPS1 doesn't have that much water. That was really hard.	2	1	2
6029	3	The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he's pobably suffering from lack of water. He's probably really hot seeing he's the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he can't see around the next turn he doesn't know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.	1	1	1
6030	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist "traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June." He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank "water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills," is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.	3	2	3
6031	3	The narration of "Rough Road ahead" a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states "I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June". To disappointed the truck stop's water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal.	3	2	3
6032	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
6033	3	The features of the setting in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking "through the high desert of california in June." So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases "a tarlike substance followed by brackish water" he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that "l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June." He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I'd never be warm again similar to He cyclist who's environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   	3	3	3
6034	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don't want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn't a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote "old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office" helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don't go anywhere is a bad idea. "Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills". This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water.	2	2	2
6035	3	"In the story "Do not exceed posted speed limit""  the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there many things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"". Because he did what to get lost. When he had to and other towns. The next example is when he came to a rock in the road:  And had to get water form a old rusted pump because he had really no water left in his water bottle"	1	1	1
6036	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain "Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills" this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone "I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path" he also. Though he was in a ghost town. "Summer time" rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding. This is the message the author tries to give"	2	2	2
6037	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town	2	2	2
6038	3	The features of the setting effects the cyclist by the way that the auther started talking and how he sound at the beginning of the story. When they both at the picture he looks like hes cecilla ssing and then ceoos. To the story and goo continue ties reads. It doesn't sound like he is enjoying his ride, because of the niuse he was down on the bumpy roads, sparkes, and the bor of counter tirst he doesn't have. hes sacting time and sec from add perso doesn't mic at all because there could hou old –timers and don't know once thou are tailoring around her, to save, to goo shouldn't take advice from them because goo could end its line this nidsnes transitin califend doesn't and how feres how could now do it, to let some or therefore so be dehydrated.	2	2	2
6039	3	In the story "Do not exceed posted speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6040	3	In the essay ‘ Rough Road Ahead Do Not exede posted speed him if many of the featutres of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist goes by river wich he wount find later in the journey.As he goes along in the journey the heat and lack of water starts to affect him. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has long since been shut down. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting.	1	1	1
6041	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble. He sad "when I tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid.	2	1	2
6042	3	The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He longs for, "the cool pines and rushing rivers…" (@NUM1). Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him. His destination fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey.	2	2	2
6043	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.	1	1	1
6044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up. 	1	2	2
6045	3	The cyclist was well prepaired for his adventure however hot enuff for a change in senary. When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2	2
6046	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn't much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback.	1	1	1
6047	3	The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if it's perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition.	1	1	1
6048	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, "I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1	1
6049	3	In the story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another.	1	1	1
6050	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist's attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, "I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly" If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, " I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph" This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3	3	3
6051	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty "…. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. "when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. "Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. "This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1	1
6052	3	How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn't be in a place that's dry.Like in the story it says "I was travelling through the high parts of California in June" meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text "I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back" which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it's a bad place for them to ride.	2	2	2
6053	3	The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus. I think the features of the setting affect the cycleist by people think they are worse than the actually are.	1	1	1
6054	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1	1
6055	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn't as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says "The sun was beginning to beat down." This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn't realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. 	2	2	2
6056	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author's well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid.	1	1	1
6057	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author write, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. ""As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he @MONTH1 never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park.The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. ""The setting of the cyclist""s journey greatly affected how he percieved his journey."	3	3	3
6058	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the "town" had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this "town" is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1	2
6059	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, "short rolling hills," and arround a,"ridiculously large snake," and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting	1	1	1
6060	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they can't just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump.	1	1	1
6061	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, "Rough Road Ahead" which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3	3
6062	3	 The bike rider in the short story "Do not exceed posted speed limit" by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can't find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldn't have has either problems.	1	1	1
6063	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch's fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2	2
6064	3	In the passage,the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water.Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains.Where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place.Both of these features had a great a tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles.	2	2	2
6065	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, "Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, "tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake." This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, "no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."	2	2	2
6066	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could affect how the cyclist is riding . If it's to hot the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster . And if it's to cold then the cyclist would @MONTH1 be get sick . Also if it‘s  too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going in the wind's direction.	1	1	1
6067	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.   	1	1	1
6068	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says "Rough Road Ahead…(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water.	2	1	2
6069	3	The features of the setting affect the the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills, he would have to slow down so he could manuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke.	1	2	2
6070	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.	2	2	2
6071	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist's surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in "the high deserts of California in June," the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2	2
6072	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips." There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. "Not two miles into the next section." He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. "I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2	2
6073	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn't see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn't see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch's factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination.	2	1	2
6074	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He's in California in June, and it's very hot. It's pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist.	2	2	2
6075	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the "resevoir compground" he's feeling pretty good because he's just leaving "the serenity of an early-summer evening and he's headed toward "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite." He's in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he's anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the "ghost town" and the "sun was beginning to beat down" he's less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he's still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once "a thriving little spot." Next, when the cyclist comes to "one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral" he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a "tarlike substance" so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the "rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake" it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom" and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. 	3	3	3
6076	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody's there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he's in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody's around town in able to help him out or anything. Let's say that he gets lost and he'll need direction to get wherever he's going well there's nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. 	1	2	2
6077	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn't very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6078	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2	2
