7280	3	In the story," Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, "Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills "@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure" tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me." The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3	3	3
7281	3	In the story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy, he is sweating so much, he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it and still has a long ride ahead of him. "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."(Kurmaskie's) since is was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated.	1	2	2
7282	3	In the book ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie the setting was in codi, California. The author went on a journey	1	1	1
7283	3	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.	1	1	1
7284	3	"In this story the cyclest was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained of boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle. This was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways."	3	2	3
7285	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said "And I promised myself right then that I'd always stick to it in the future."	3	3	3
7286	3	In the short story " Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed pusted speed limit." A lot of things affeced cyclist. Such as the rocky road , and the lack of water for example where the author says "when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid." this shows how has loosing lope, and he seems a little scared. Also the abandond towns  didn't help.	1	1	1
7287	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, "The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips" and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.	2	2	2
7288	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY DEPLETING HIS WATER SUPPLY, AND ALMOST GIVING HIM HEAT EXHAUSTION. IN THE TEXT, HE SAYS: THE WATER BOTTLES CONTAINED ONLY A FEW TANTALIZING SIPS." THIS HOTNES HE HAS LITTLE WATER LEFT FOR SURVIVAL UNTIL HE RUNS OUT.	1	1	1
7289	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had "a smile on." (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn't energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist.	2	2	2
7290	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if their going down hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike. If their going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill. Usually if their riding in a shady area then the wear clothes to keep them cool. But if their going to be in the sun the they need to wear light clothes. The setting affects the rider very much.	1	1	1
7291	3	"The setting in "Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake "a ridiculously large"" snake – it realy didn't look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me "(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."	2	2	2
7292	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   "	2	2	2
7293	3	The fetures in the settings like hills, make the cycleist use more energy, the more enegy that he uses the more water he will whant to drink. This is difficult because he states "The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips". Therefore he was in trouble.	2	2	2
7294	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he's pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.	2	2	2
7295	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist's mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men's knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. "I'd read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat." The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn't care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best.	3	3	3
7296	3	In the story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has alongride. Where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough. He was running out of water in the desert. "I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out." @CAPS1 that he is off his bike he least worrie about the posionous snakes of the desert. He founded Welch's grape juice factory but it was abandoned. The author found a bait shop and got water	2	2	2
7297	3	In the short story "Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate. He also experiences changes in land structure which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning is why the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7298	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. "The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt." By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn't help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was "water depleting @NUM2."	2	1	2
7299	3	The features  of the   setting   does   affect the cyclist. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7300	3	"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, "ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, "The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed," this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person."	2	2	2
7301	3	"The features of the setting stronger, effect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The features of the land;in, and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of june also effect this story.The dry and hills land is a huge factor for the main character. Because if is hilly, he has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he his thirsty and has no where to get anything to drink.The land is also desert, so there is no where he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization. He believes that he is not going to make it. The text explains in paragraph !!, "" the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a goregous day on June simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh"" The setting plays a huge role in the story. It is hot, dry, and deserted this out effects the main character and journey."	3	3	3
7302	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states "This sight was troubleing," He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce "A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water". Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He	3	3	3
7303	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, " The  sun was beginning to beat down , " (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired ‘because ‘ it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ". (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 	2	2	2
7304	3	that   explains  for my features I'm the of the setting affect the cyclist. the   essay that support your conclusion is the cyclist .the features is the setting becaused the cyclist the Include the support for the conclusion.	0	0	0
7305	3	The scenery makes the cyclist hapy. He's sooooooooooooo happsy! Woohoo! happsy	0	0	0
7306	3	In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over @NUM1 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist.	1	1	1
7307	3	The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @PERSON1 "Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit." The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part until the directions he was given by "a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office." takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the men's directions, the setting was enjoyable a made for an easy ride a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says "The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them." This confidence begins to depleat as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says "sometimes life can feel so cruel." after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn't even reach that limit. However, he's determined and pushes through to reach a shop. This gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence. So in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation.	3	2	3
7308	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him ???  are ??? like when he rood through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story thats all that talk about. And when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road. He was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in ??? ??? ???.	2	2	2
7309	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn't change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2	3	3
7310	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult.	2	2	2
7311	3	In the short story, "Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.	1	1	1
7312	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are "the cool pines and rushing rivers" they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.	2	1	2
7313	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In ‘Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says "Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
7314	3	Heat, dessert, humidity – all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, "… water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips." This means that the day is hot and running out of water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims "There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind." @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey.	2	2	2
7315	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers "shortcut" as he states that "things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." But what he didn't know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first "town" which was a ghost town. He wasn't overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how "a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.	3	3	3
7316	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn't for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1°. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn't help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber's fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who "haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office." The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.	1	1	1
7317	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit" the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, "Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office." Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. 	2	2	2
7318	3	The features in the setting affect cyclist in many ways. One of which is bring only to carry so much equipment which @MONTH1 be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of there are no buildings or anything around that you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can't just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist.	1	1	1
7319	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says "the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June." This means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. ""a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule." He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the "overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them." This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it."	3	3	3
7320	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn't have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn't able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
7321	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day…." (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.	2	2	2
7322	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because	1	1	1
7323	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn't have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened.   	1	1	1
7324	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The want of the California desert canes the cyclist to became tired and dehydrated. For example the another states "I cased past, trying to keep my balance dehydrated star," The setting is the main factory which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated.	1	1	1
7325	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills is wearing him out. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off.	1	1	1
7326	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, "It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, "sometimes life can feel so cruel." @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful."	2	2	2
7327	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. he hit some bad and nasty water. along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink, he was very dehydrated and had to drink nesles water. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad but he had to. at one point a big snake almost took up the entire road and he had to just ease his way on by it, his riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, he said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on, he finally found a bathroom, went inside it drank water from the sink and yellced to a man that told him the direction he wanted	2	2	2
7328	3	"The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says "there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." @CAPS1 basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because hes alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says "Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" @CAPS1 pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen."	1	1	1
7329	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. How because there was not a posted speed limit up there cause the cyclist went right throw and over goin faster then he was suppored to.	1	1	1
7330	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story.	1	2	2
7331	3	When you do something really to often you get used to it, well I think is the same thing with how sitting affects the cyclist features. It might make their butt flat or their back has a diferent shape and with different shep I dont mean that they are diformed but evey person is diferen so their back can either have a "@CAPS1" shape or an "I" shape or a "D" shape.	0	0	0
7332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. "wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June." The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2	3
7333	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. "Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills "(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and eneegy, especially for bike riders. "high deserats of California in June "(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to heat overheated when exerting much force at once. These two co	2	2	2
7334	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he's keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future.	1	1	1
7335	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, "About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.' This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town." This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn't seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.	3	3	3
7336	3	In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist's condition. For example, the author wrote "Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye" The way the author described the hill as "crippling" should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist's journey was, "that smoky blues tune ''Summer time" rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain." This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist's condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader's perception of the cyclist's journey.   	3	2	3
7337	3	The terrain the cyclist faces don't help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot & made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didn't have any energy left after all of that he wouldn't have been able to get to the baits shop.	2	2	2
7338	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn't know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn't know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn't have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can't get energy, so he can't ride the bike.	1	1	1
7339	3	The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, "At same point, tumple weed crossed my path." This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest.	2	2	2
7340	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2	2
7341	3	The feature in the setting affeted the cyclist alot. It was a hot summer day and he was running out of water. With oll the heat he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have alot of energy, ?? the sun were tiding it from him.	1	1	1
7342	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles beceuse it was hot and was a mough train.	1	1	1
7343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town  the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit. That shows that the ground is going to be rough.	1	1	1
7344	3	The features of the setting in, "Rough Road Ahead" negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. "I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable." When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid." @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly." I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage" He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people " crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement." As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, "Rough Road Ahead."	3	3	3
7345	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead your just going to have to be able and to handle the up and downs, bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean.	1	1	1
7346	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives.	1	1	1
7347	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cool pines keep the sun from beating down on him and from getting heatstroke. Another way is that the towns he he went to had either bad as or no water and he was becoming dehydrated. The heat from the sun was make him feel funny, he was hoping he wasn't seeing mirages.	1	1	1
7348	3	The cyclist does most really like the setting of the road. It's messing up big time	0	0	0
7349	3	The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. He says, "there is no one in sight, not a building,car, or structure of any kind." As you can see that kind of setting would definetly affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7350	3	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strenght at first a tar like substance oozed out follwed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills , follwed by a snake that looked od a diamond back.	1	1	1
7351	3	In the essay "Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." By Joe Kurmaskie. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says "Not June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills." @CAPS1 example is "Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke." These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from a old person, exspecially if its hot and you are riding a bike.	1	1	1
7352	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid," that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."	2	2	2
7353	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, "...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June." @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, "the sun was beginning to beatdown..." @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, "...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town." There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. "I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out." There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty.	2	2	2
7354	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist's attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump "black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.	3	2	3
7355	3	"The cyclist in "Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" starts off in the "serenity of an easly summer evening" taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn't mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his "short cut" was not so short after all. The "high deserts of California in June" and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with "no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind" made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he'd be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a "Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant." @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  "	3	3	3
7356	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and nothing around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot. It was dry every where around him so he couldn't stop anywhere and cool off. Also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. This is how the setting affected him.	1	2	2
7357	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California  made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.	1	1	1
7358	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with. 	1	1	1
7359	3	I think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management	0	0	0
7360	3	"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. "but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town." This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven't peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch's building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park."	2	2	2
7361	3	The cyclist see his journey affect by a succesion of events that will make his journey trave?? every time more difficul and difficult. One of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at. @CAPS1 (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) The temperature of the desert also influenced him (I was travelling through high desert of California). The  cyclist also finds his' self with a combination of emotions at times he thinks he is going to past away and at times he believes he will be fine. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) As i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drunk deeply from the sink, I thought i had a over whelming wigs to seek Gary.	2	3	3
7362	3	"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the ??.???? the what he steal inside that ""I reached myself riht then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not  ?? the sight and felt he walking not make, fall on the ?? and get dust stick. Did he ??? want to happen gian so be ?? to always look at the map.     "	1	2	2
7363	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals	1	1	1
7364	3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can't exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn't ask for directions. So the lession is don't take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. 	3	2	3
7365	3	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said "Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit". which this means slow down or you will have an accident. Another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said "The water bottles contained  water a few tantalizing sips" which means it was few left.	2	1	2
7366	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he's out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, "I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid." @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, "yes- sir: I own a very good map." @CAPS2 by this he's understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he'll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.	3	2	3
7367	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says "neihbor hood of two hundred degrees." He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.	1	1	1
7368	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to discribe the setting like "flat road" and "short, rolling hills", There were also more example. The way the cyclist discribed the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting.	1	1	1
7369	3	In the story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, that's what the setting is like. When he got the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrators mood.	1	1	1
7370	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road. Another obstacle from the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of @NUM1 hundred degrees. Everytime he pumped it wouldn't cool down and the water tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly that is why he needed new water. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to beat down so he was dehydrated. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back.  	2	2	2
7371	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the the short story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" The getting of the story is, "a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California" during the early summer. Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution.	3	3	3
7372	3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date. Then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the old's men's short cut through the desert with one meschy bottle of water. It was really hot out side and the sun was scorging down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he ??? and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water. This made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride. The settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he would have took the route that was on the map then he would have know where he was and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in the moth to reserve water or thoughts of finding water he would 	3	3	3
7373	3	"The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. ""This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. ""It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. "	2	3	3
7374	3	The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldn't bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,	1	1	1
7375	3	In the story "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie the different aspects of the setting effect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins he doesn't even notice how hot it is and he says, "the ran was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it." His mood starts to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water of becomes increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irriates him when he realize the water tastes like "battery acid." As he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandone. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water.	2	2	2
7376	3	"Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn't have good water, "when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, "in my dehydrated state" (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him."	2	2	2
7377	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don't have much water which is what he needed and he couldn't find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.	2	2	2
7378	3	The cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill. The setting of story affects the cyclist alot. This is because in California it is really good to be cycling. The weather is warm and perfect for a town. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule greeted him.Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit.	2	1	2
7379	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion.	1	2	2
7380	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off – road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story "Do Exceed posted Speed Limit", by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, "I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.	2	2	2
7381	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls "At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me" (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he'd not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber's fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.	3	3	3
7382	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me." This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber" This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."	2	2	2
7383	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw "short, rolling hills," tumbleweeds" and "a ridiculously large shake," and he thought that he was not getting anywhere.	1	1	1
7384	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.	1	1	1
7385	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider followed their advice instead of taking the right way he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town in got help.	1	1	1
7386	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.	1	1	1
7387	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says." The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he's running out of water when he says."The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips." @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting."	3	2	3
7388	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved	2	2	2
7389	3	In the story "Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit," the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says "The sun was beginning to beat down. "This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is "I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees "this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2	3	3
7390	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns and the lonelyness it say in the text "About forty miles into the pedal. I arrived at the first town."	1	1	1
7391	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that every where he would go, he couldn't find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, "Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the cyclist qoutes."At same point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake." @CAPS1 your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing  harsher conditions can only give you no hope .He soon almost ran out of water only made things worst.The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist , settings had alot to do with his journey."	3	3	3
7392	3	The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself "the next town was only eighteen miles." After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills." this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would "take your mind off of thirst." When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride	3	2	3
7393	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.	2	2	2
7394	3	The setting of the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit" affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states "I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June." @CAPS1 feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them	1	1	1
7395	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he's in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn't supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn't have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him.	1	1	1
7396	3	In ‘Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn't even have any cool water. As the character says, "…followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn't help him either. It didn't quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn't take anyone's advice.	3	2	3
7397	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. "@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake." This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.	2	1	2
7398	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, "it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town." It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn't refill hi water.	1	1	1
7399	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only "    eighteen miles down the road." He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he "conserved his water ..." and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.	1	1	1
7400	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.	1	1	1
7401	3	Setting in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  " a water-depleting @NUM1." When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like "battery acid." Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now.	3	2	3
7402	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had a couple of problems turning his journey little, amount of water, tough roads, including there were no cars on the road either. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist like on page @NUM1 paragraph one the first sentence "It didn't really matter. In was going to die and the birds would pick me down" The elements were so tough on the cyclist that he or she was going to going to give hope. But luckly in the end the cyclist found a place to stop and get water with directions.	1	2	2
7403	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, "a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees". The cyclist doesn't have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, "the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant". He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	1	2
7404	3	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   	2	2	2
7405	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn't rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  	2	3	3
7406	3	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by making him dehydrated and dies. Also in the setting he found the abandon factory which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting was elsewhere then this setting he would have felt different as he didn't  meet the people  of the reserve he could have been in the better roads than the old roads he was in	1	1	1
7407	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. "The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I'm sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing." That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. "With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author's "Short, rolling hills", the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I'm sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    	3	3	3
7408	3	"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in "Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly, first he statrs off happy because he's going to Yosemite national park and he'd gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs," Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch's grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old man's there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."	1	1	1
7409	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn't have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. "I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. "This statement proves that the cyclist wasn't a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren't there, but you want to see those things. " I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. "It was a good decision that the cyclist didn't get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.	2	2	2
7410	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"	2	3	3
7411	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information @MONTH1 not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong.	1	1	1
7412	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn't any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road.	2	2	2
7413	3	The features of the setting in "DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT" affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on.	3	2	3
7414	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1	1
7415	3	"The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called  "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit". Cyclist are in very good physical shape. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist. This happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey. "I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. "Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake….". "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips". The cyclist was tired and exhausted. The weather and terrain had worn him down. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I can't play as long. The features of a setting can clearly affect people."	3	2	3
7416	3	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June" This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says "The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips." This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride.	2	2	2
7417	3	"The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn't good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can't help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they're landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist."	3	2	3
7418	3	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she caldn't go as fast, "The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph," so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, "I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down." @CAPS1 how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function.  	2	2	2
7419	3	"In the story "Rough Road Ahead" the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes. When he pumped the water, no  come out. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect. The cyclist gave ""teaches life can be so cruel"" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said "my troubles thirst and feels he all behind me" different settings in the story gave the author a different affect. "	2	3	3
7420	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said "flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills" The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn't seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, "The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it." He didn't know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.	3	3	3
7421	3	"The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirsties and less active. The story says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt."""	1	1	1
7422	3	My point of view that affect a cyclist that people need to recycle sometimes people is throwing away trash can with soda in side of it people cyclist now in days some times they need to change that role my conclusion people need to save stuff to make some new things to make a good quality world of cyclist things.	0	0	0
7423	3	The cyclist listen to the geogers. after a while he starts to get tired. After the seenery desert change he starts to get mad. He criticizes himself for accepting advice from "old-timers who haven't left the	2	2	2
7424	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the "fork of sorts" as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn't. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3	3	3
7425	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his enduranc. The amount of time he can ride without stopping, houever long he can ride up hill, how ever many bumps he rides over, however long he can ride without a drink of water.	1	1	1
7426	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes the occur while riding his bike. The cyclist began well with smily face, but then he changed because the condition of the road and the weather that was hot, also there was not any signal to show him where he was going and it was the correct way he was taking. Also, his bike flat needed to be replaced.	1	1	1
7427	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He has tine ling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, @CAPS1 that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder.  The @CAPS1 had to prit more effort into it because the romds here long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He @CAPS1 ran into a snake which told him that I am getting deeper into the desert.	2	2	2
7428	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as "the high deserts of California." The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the "flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills," it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.	3	3	3
7429	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema."… @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the… pavement in front of me." He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that "really did look like a diamondback." @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it's a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles." I'd read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate." * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of 	3	2	3
7430	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far and there was nothing in sight no cars, building or stucture of any kind.	1	1	1
7431	3	The author was affected in many ways be the conclusion. He was tired from the blazing heat, didn't have much water, and got lost. Water simple was limiting and as he went farther and farther it seemed like thing would get worser and worser for him. A man had gave him the wrong directions and he probably hadn't been off his porch in decades the author saids.	2	2	2
7432	3	In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example," Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry.	1	1	1
7433	3	"In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn't know."	2	2	2
7434	3	Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor. These affected the cyclist in a major way.	1	1	1
7435	3	"'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself."	3	3	3
7436	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn't drink. Also , the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart.	2	2	2
7437	3	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the "high deserts of California in June." That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first "town" he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it's hot, and he's tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date.	2	2	2
7438	3	Well the setting was the lil boy was on the bike and he meets this old man and the man toke him a short cut. So he took dis road and I guess something went wrong.	1	1	1
7439	3	In the "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion.	2	2	2
7440	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains "there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.	2	2	2
7441	3	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??	1	1	1
7442	3	The The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the cyclist @CAPS1 challenging porblem face by the author. Forexample, I nottice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway. That's shows when he arrived, the road does not good and also large highway high of jumped.	1	1	1
7443	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY IT BEING SO HOT OUTSIDE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD PASSED OUT AND DIED. ALSO HE SAW A SNAKE THAT SCARED HIM TO DEATH BUT HE PASSED THE SNAKE. ALSO HE SAW A BUILDING THAT COULD PROBABLY HELP HIM BUT IT WAS ABANDONED,IT WAS A WELCH FACTORY THEN AS HE RUNS FURTHER DOWN HE SAW A FISH PLACE AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET SOME WATER then somebody asked him where he was going and they tined totzy him but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.	2	3	3
7444	3	In the story "Rough Road Ahead" a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn't help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found "several rusty pumps," and "one ramshackle shed." This probably didnt help him because he didn't have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn't get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that "There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind" and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn't setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story "Rough road ahead" the setting in the story didn't help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn't help that he was in a desert.	3	3	3
7445	3	"Well since the cyclist is in a desert and out of mother he is probably not going to be happy. The ""ghost towns"" aren't really a boost of confidence either. The rugged hills made him angry too. The heat affected him the most."	1	1	1
7447	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. 	1	1	1
7448	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.	2	2	2
7449	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he "enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers." The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the "collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office" and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber's Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he "promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future.   	2	3	3
7450	3	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. "I hung my head," means that he was depressed. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking @CAPS1.	2	2	2
7451	3	I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged.	1	1	1
7452	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring like to drink more water. When no one else was around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if there's a chance that he is on the wrong path, and no body available to tell him otherwise. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining. If the setting were different, this story would not have been as traumatic.	2	2	2
7453	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE "SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN," AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN "GHOST TOWNS" THAT CONSISTS OF "RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS" AND "SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS." THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN'T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS "TUMBLEWEEDS" AND "PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES" ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE "@NUM1 ROAD" ONLY DOING "12 MPH." ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A "LONG CROPPING HILL," THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???	3	2	3
7454	3	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they won't get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be "Never accept to	1	1	1
7455	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. "Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake". After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn't taken the "shortcut" that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2	3	3
7456	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch's Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, "with all my strength." @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because "it had the flavor of battery acid." Next, the Welch's Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of "a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice", made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2's peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle." He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3	3	3
7457	3	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story I was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if I was in the story I not be good becaus the story is really crazy I would be realy good two start and right	0	0	0
7458	3	In the setting they are in lodi, California. That is a part of the desert. The desert effects the cyclist real bad. For one it is really hot. Two the heat is making him thirsty and is running out of his water. Then last he is near no towns so he can't get anymore water, so the setting does effect the cyclist.	2	1	2
7459	3	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.	1	1	1
7460	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid as he continued on his ride he got hotter and hotter hoping to find water after he finished of his last bit. Taking advices from an old man was and his last decision he made.	1	1	1
7461	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. "and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day" This is an example of how he lost courage. I wanted to be brave and be strong. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear" This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn't want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to , he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic.	2	2	2
7462	3	The features of his journey are cruel. "Rolling hills," make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don't really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough.	2	1	2
7463	3	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. It says in  the reading " flat road was replaced by short rolling hills" this would wear a person out without a good supply of water and is not sure in what direction he is travelling. And another thin g that affects him is the hot june weather in California.	2	1	2
7464	3	Throughout "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry and dangerous. There was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy. The speaker stated, "At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously lareg snake..."  (Kurmaskie @NUM1).The cyclist fared land blockings and dangerous animals. This cause him to slow down a little bit. It was extremely not out in the setting he was in. The cyclist was in the deserts of California in June.The speaker stated, "@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June..." (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expirencing the high temperatures of the setting. The cyclist witnessed the intense  features of the setting.	2	2	2
7465	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional when he said that  if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town.	2	2	2
7466	3	The features of the setting started out easy like a road thats flat cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it sat harder lack of water road is not flat anymore snakes the cool pines are gone. 	1	1	1
7467	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3	2	3
7468	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert like environment and their was no one ground for most of it so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected when in the story when he says ''I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substaNce oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. That affected him because, he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and he was almost out so he needed to fill up with more but he did not have a place to get more water. That is one of the features of the setting that affected him.	1	1	1
7469	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn't know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had.	2	2	2
7470	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water because he is trying to traverse the terrain. In the setting there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California" The word ""high"" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said "flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." When the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain. another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills, "tumbleweeds crossed in path." The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are associated with the desert which brought up the thought & dying and being picked apart by birds."	2	2	2
7471	3	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if it's a sad story and it's a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. That's how the setting makes it better.	1	1	1
7472	3	If it is hot Out you can dehydrate quickley. also, if is ff ong hand hilly you use a lot of energy. It can berough on equipment, body, and mind. Make sure you dress apropreit lyand carry lot so f water. Next, make sure your tiresa inflated and all equip is working properly. then, plan a good route that you can stopat places and catch a breath or some water. also, make sure you eat well, food provides a lot of energy.	2	2	2
7473	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	2	3	3
7474	3	"In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It sas that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the directions are out of date. The reason think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the continues of their porches since carter was in office."" The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride upand down through what he though of as it, rough terrain. That is what I think affected the cyclist."	2	2	2
7475	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie's "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill." In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says "and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke." This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quick. "	2	2	2
7476	3	In "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit," the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said "This place might have been a thriving little spot… but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town." He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. "I was traveling through the deserts of California in June." He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit," by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water.	2	2	2
7477	3	In the story "Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits," The setting is a long road with "no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind he cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he have to ride down.	1	1	1
7478	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he "enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening". The word "serenity" gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the "ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule" in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating "Rough Road Ahead". Kurmaskie's confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a "rather modern bathroom" where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie's confidence is followed by determination and then relief.	3	3	3
7479	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a dessert like place with a water surfage and he could hard tired. I would never have asked old people, he should have ask someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times. also he could have died if that snake got him or from what he said "heatroke."	1	1	1
7480	3	The story begins as the author, a cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike-ridden destination of Yosemite National park. He starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described. It is a ghost town and amuses the author still believing he's perfectly fine he sets out again this time arriving at a place with "One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule" It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is low. He preceeds past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds and different land-marks. Each one rips his confidence and exciterent to shreds. Especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of "Gary wilber's fish camp," and refreshes himself and his dried-out hope. Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out.	3	3	3
7481	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says "There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1	1	1
7482	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder. The old people made him go through the rocky way. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said "When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid." The heat could have killed him anytime. For example "Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June." This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.  	2	2	2
7483	3	"The settnig can greatly effect the cyclist. The palce can change what happens and how it happens. For example if the story had taken place in alaska the cyclist would not have had, ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt."" and instead have been fighting off hypo thermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing. "	2	2	2
7484	3	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.	1	1	1
7485	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." For example, he finds a "ramshackle shed" and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, "I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1	1	1
7486	3	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, "Over one long, crippling hill" (kurmaskie @NUM1). This work choice reflects the writer's feeling about his adventure. Words like "long" and "crippling" show that the trip was a horrible experience.	1	1	1
7487	3	Pride, determination, relief – all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, "a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it." After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, "I gathered – a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst." This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, "As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.	2	3	3
7488	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. "A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen." This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 	1	1	1
7489	3	I work better when I can feel the  environment.  I think  the some goes  for  cycling  in  the  mountain , fresh air and no worries  on  you  mind them  cycling can become fun like the climates into the easy he even the fresh air,  the fine trees and the environment  makes him feel  better  so for cyclist environment plays a vital role.	1	1	1
7490	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.	2	2	2
7491	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist. "This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this "town" he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty. "Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke..." The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he's talked to the old men for directions he hasn't seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. So this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. 	3	3	3
7492	3	The cyclist traked through a barren land trying to get to a land of rivers and valleys. Trakling through the first town the cyclist saw a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps and corral lotated in the desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town, however he kept hope and traveled to the next town. Their, he found a abandond fruit juice factory and bottling plant, how the discuraged the cyclist started to give up. "I was going to die," he clamed with all hope loot. The man feels like their is nothing left and it's the old men who caused this. Then finally, he cme across a bait shop which he found an his own giving him a huge reliefe. The features effects his attitude because in a baren land you lose hope as did the cyclist. Therefore, what's around us affect us as in education, friendship, and survival.	2	2	2
7493	3	In the essay, "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected doth emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. "[The] sight was troubling,"(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. "I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he finds an old fishermans store, he is relieved seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because, he could finally have a drink. The author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting.	3	2	3
7494	3	The features of the setting in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and wornout from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home then he saw some buildings down a hill and said "With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill" (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider gets home he says he is going to do it again.	2	2	2
7495	3	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it's going to be very hot and he'll need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch's Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesn't help his dehydration. That's why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you're riding a bike during the summer	2	2	2
7496	3	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.	1	1	1
7497	3	In the short story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" a cyclist is going against heat lack of water and rough hills trying to maneuver around.	1	1	1
7498	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is tRying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiRing. Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison.	2	2	2
7499	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went."	1	1	1
7500	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house. For example in the story it says, "Never accept travel advice from collection of old. times who haven't left confines of their porches since carter was in office." This affecting the setting because if it weren't for his map and let them take a peek at it, That would of saved him a load of trouble.	1	1	1
7501	3	In "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says "Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees" this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says "I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength." This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best. 	2	2	2
7502	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, "Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view". This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, "There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind". Also it says in the story "I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3	3
7503	3	Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him.	3	2	3
7504	3	"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the "old timers" were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says" The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed." He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was "trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. "With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, "gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth" just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon " Gary and wilber's fish camp best bet" then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."	3	3	3
7505	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."""	3	2	3
7506	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day he can't go to fast due to his lung capacity. If it is a warm but windy day he has to wath his speed to keep from getting hurt. Basically unless the weather is nice or safe enough he will go fast. But his safty care first so it depend on the weather mostly but also the time of the day. If it is night [dark] the reflectors must be put on to keep from getting it.	1	1	1
7507	3	The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about "two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid." If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.	1	1	1
7508	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. the long hill is one example the snake and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him.	1	1	1
7509	3	"There were many features of the setting that affeced the cyclist. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states rough road a head. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long onpiling hill." He also the tempature as started on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 " l was travling in hing desertd of california in June. These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist."	1	1	1
7510	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says "…and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke…" (@NUM1). This quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding. The narrarator also says, "I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"(@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain. In conclusion, the setting affected the cyclist in this story.	2	1	2
7511	3	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike. And to see what is up ahead. By riding a bike in the heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the heat. That's why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike.	1	1	1
7512	3	THE CYCLIST SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY "ROUGH ROAD AHEAD. THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT IN THE SUMMER TIME WITH HARDLY ANY WATER. HE IS TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM	1	2	2
7513	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3	2	3
7514	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist because the determine how easy or hard he ride is for the cyclist. For example. The land being hot, would enable him to die or heat struck without water, the land being dry means he doesn't have a place to refill his water supply and the land being barren means to the man that if he didn't be of heat stroke there is a chance he wouldn't be found and wouldn't survive. Another example of how the features of the setting offer the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed time sign his though are about here he is going a water depleating 12 mph. This shows that he features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness or he road make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibley be the biggest arrest on a cyclist, and whether they have a long hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit like in this story or a nice lersury ride."	3	2	3
7515	3	The cyclist "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you're doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said "In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant." He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying "I'm going to die." - and physically by becoming dehydrated.	2	2	2
7516	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, "In the high deserts of California in June." It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they'd been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could've fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would've died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn't go through.	2	3	3
7517	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in manyway. The hills are to long. Every town is fear appert and the rodes are rought. The heat also affectes him. He is affected health wise.	1	1	1
7518	3	When your doing any sport or any thing were you sweat your setting is everything. If your sweating in a setting you can easily get sick. The setting from the story Rough road ahead the cyclist had no water and the setting was very hot. Thats why the cyclist was tired and sick because he was sweating and had no water. Thats how the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7519	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist  greatly. The features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think All hope is lost. The essay says this "Over one long crippling hill, a bulding came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune ""summertime rattle around."" Then to a happy mo In an ironic twist that should please all sadist reading this, the building [...] by the looks  afit had been a welch's  grape Juice factory and bottling plant [...] I hung my head that smoky bluees tune sumertime rattle around." Then to a happy mood it states "As I stumbled into a ra ther modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, i had a overwhelming  urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.""  "	2	2	2
7520	3	With no one around and rough road ahead not to mention dehydration the cyclist begin to feel he was going to die. Because of this he began to dout himself but each time he saw something he tried to get there.	1	1	1
7521	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, "no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind," he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to "short, rolling hills". Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed "crippling", My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.	2	3	3
7522	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, "the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name." He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. "I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid." He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self," sometimes life can be so cruel," he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.	2	2	2
7523	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist's moods in many ways. The story says. "About fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ""town." ""The cyclist is probably allready tired from pedaling for fourty miles. Then he finds out that the town is desserted, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also desserted and he is almost out of water. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water ,and he is relieved. As you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story."	2	2	2
7524	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that  its in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given wrong	1	2	2
7525	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that "helped" him acused think to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shop or buildings that were inhabined. This way there was no place for him to get any water nouroushment.       	2	2	2
7526	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says "Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts", This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn't know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says "I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength". That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn't think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says "Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road.	2	3	3
7527	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in, has many caations and	2	2	2
7528	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don't get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise.	2	3	3
7529	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity.	1	1	1
7530	3	From reading the story, l believe the setting of the desert he was cycling affected him immensly. I believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and hydrated. As time and miles went on the scenery mover changed.That can be really hard. in heated water or, you need to be as hydrated ad possible, especially it an enduring in physical activity. When time he went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing in think about a long other them, how much larger, how thirsty he was  and is this worth it? It is a lot eager to the motivated when there is thing to look at to keep your mind of the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. In my point of view strongly believe that it could have been form working at the some sandy desert for seeds a long period of time. I have ??? ??? ??? in exercising while making on  ???. It's hard to see  ??????????? thing. My attitude will go farm." I'm so determined to I'm bored " to" what's the point." But I thought it was great how he never gave up ??? things got bad. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to reacts your own goals.        	2	2	2
7531	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, "I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, "I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."	1	1	1
7532	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. That's where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. That's how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.   	1	1	1
7533	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, "Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing" (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey.	1	2	2
7534	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run–down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  	3	3	3
7535	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. @NUM1 way is the condition of roads. Another is the heat. Another is snakes. Another is no town insight. The final one is lack of info. @MONTH1 be the guy made it. @MONTH1 be he got hurt on the ride.  Maybe a snake bit him. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.   	1	1	1
7536	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn't know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about "the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite." This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.	1	1	1
7537	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water	1	1	1
7538	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. "There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind." The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get excited." He was very doubtful he'd get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  	2	2	2
7539	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story "The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2". This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said "flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. "	3	2	3
7540	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surrondings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasn't so sure if he shold keep going. As well as when he didn't see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But  as second road sign appeared he was relieved.	2	1	2
7541	3	The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks it's only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would've been no one there to help.	2	2	2
7542	3	The features of the setting of "Do not exceed posted speed limit" greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says "tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me." The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch's Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned.	3	2	3
7543	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, "I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water "a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel". Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the "battery acid" tasting water. Also there was the Welch's grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. "A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head". As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist.	3	3	3
7544	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny "old codgers" and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn't the least bit established anymore, he's slightly disappointed, but sees it as "a test of [his] inner spirit." At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing 	1	1	1
7545	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says "and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3	3	3
7546	3	The desert is the crulest of nature's environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit", cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert's heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, "wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke." If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, " I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. "As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, "the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear".	3	2	3
7547	3	"The features in the setting of the essay "Rough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limit" affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read "The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph" This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch's Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with "A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel."	3	3	3
7548	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next "town" and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch's factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming "the birds will pick me clean," To the cyclist also was best, then he was "saved" by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.	2	3	3
7549	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	1	1	1
7550	3	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, "the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage.	1	1	1
7551	3	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, " on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh." This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. " growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke " This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways.	2	1	2
7552	3	In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced sedring heat, dyhdration and getting wrong directions. He experienced depression and mear death. He had an encounter with a big old snake and last he reached his distination. This affected him and he learned to bring a map and not to take direction from old people.	1	1	1
7553	3	The setting affected the cycist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. "The sun was beginning to beat down." He says it didn't affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. "tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake." This could not of made his ride easier. Next the hills and roads, "over one long, crippling hill." This proves how intense his ride was. Thats how the setting affected the cyclist in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie.	1	2	2
7554	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says" i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June". this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can't find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find "towns" nearby. Once he finds them, they are either "ghost towns" or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says "At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me." @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3	2	3
7555	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.	1	1	1
7556	3	In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked all about the cyclist jouney. One feature was that his water supply was running short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water: This shows that that town had been abanodoned for years and the water supply wasn't up for drinking. The essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction.	2	2	2
7557	3	"The cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." had to go through a hard time in the California desert.  It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and ???."	1	1	1
7558	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.	2	1	2
7559	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by old people changing the definition of adon't talk to strangers. The main character	1	1	1
7560	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don't need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person's house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don't have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesn't have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win.	2	1	2
7561	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclistand now the setting around him affects his journey."	2	3	3
7562	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." If something were there, he wouldn't feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. 	1	2	2
7563	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through "The high deserts of California in June." It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could "drop from heatstroke" at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the "crippling" hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, "There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind" The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."	3	3	3
7564	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it.	2	2	2
7565	3	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 out sides, you don't need to be out there. Doesn,t matter how long you are outside for, a heatstroke could come at any body fast than they can count to @NUM2.	1	1	1
7566	3	On the way to @CAPS1 the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. This was making him tired and dehydrated. Half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. That must of been discouraging. All the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the heat.	1	1	1
7567	3	Hot, bumpy roads, no shade-all are things that affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in??? the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert," considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldn't have taken directions in the first place.	2	2	2
7568	3	The setting of "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit" effects the cyclist in many was. The words "high deserts of California in June," from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you don't have water you don't have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said "Rough Road Ahead." There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it.	2	2	2
7569	3	"The features of the setting in "Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit" affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope."	2	2	2
7570	3	In the story "Rough Road Ahead" the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey.	2	2	2
7571	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.	3	2	3
7572	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down. Rough roads did as well. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more.  The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the features seriously impared his bike ride.	2	2	2
7573	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. If the road was bumpy, he'd jump up and down a little. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.	1	1	1
7574	3	The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit" greatly affect the cyclist. I'm sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in "the california desert in the middle of June" does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I'm sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn't continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke.	3	2	3
7575	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid." The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1's Juice factory. The text says,‘a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth." These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."	2	3	3
7576	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men's directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He's also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men's directions. He's really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they've lost it. 	2	2	2
7577	3	There are many different features such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling. The weather can effect if it is rain or weather the road are messed up he could get a flat. The way that the person is feeling is a big part on weather they try hard or they do not worry about it too much.	3	2	3
7578	3	"According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states "I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June". The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states "over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view". This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist's trip and how it affected her."	3	3	3
7579	3	"In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the ‘short cut' that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the "Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills." @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. "There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."	2	2	2
7580	3	The setting adds a sense of ergancy. The cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert. If he had been in the forest or the subburbs it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dieing. He exclaims it did n't really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean."	2	2	2
7581	3	In the story, do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist was affected about the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was right but it was wrong. So it took him off track of his good he was trying to reach	1	1	1
7582	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on.	2	2	2
7583	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist's narrator's mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, "I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." Even at his first "ghost town" he just "chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on". After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, "One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men". He said, "this was troubling", it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, "He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."	3	2	3
7584	3	"In "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is affected alot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. "Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1." This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist.  "	2	2	2
7585	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didn't even no where he was goin.	1	1	1
7586	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the ‘towns' around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. 	2	1	2
7587	3	"The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat can cause that to. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop."	1	1	1
7588	3	The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park he listened to the "old timers who haven't left the confines of thier porches since Carter was in office". He went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill in to town which was empty into a hard road & snakes in his way then up a hill then went down the hill saw a abanded "Welch's Grape Juice Factory". Then he saw a sign say "Gary And Wilber's FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET!". So then he runs into the bathroom & drinks from the sink. Before he got there he was getting thirsty & tired & when he saw the abanded building he saw a young boy drinking a juice he wiped his eyes to see if he wasn't seen a mirage. So then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left then a stone went his throat. His troubles, thirst, & fear were all behind him when he saw that sign.	2	2	2
7589	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states,"The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke " This meant the heat was getting to him.	1	1	1
7590	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, "came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldn't hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling." Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel. ""@CAPS1 him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"". Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @CAPS1 his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @CAPS1 his journey seen to be harder and filled with ?? hope as strenght left to finish his goals."	3	3	3
7591	3	In the story, "Do not exceed postal speed limit," many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. "Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven't left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office." This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. "…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. "That smoky blues tune "Summer time" rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain." This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park.	3	3	3
7592	3	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distrought. He  sees the sign that sats " Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit" it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says " In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists…" he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing.	1	1	1
7593	3	IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist see's the sign that says, "Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit." So the cyclist has to be cautious	1	1	1
7594	3	The cyclist was is a horrible nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. From the heat made him drink more water and also harder to breath in extreme heat. Without those faults the cyclist would have been fine.	1	1	1
7595	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn't a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.	1	2	2
7596	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didn't follow his plan on the map he had no cloe where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps don't go crazy and they don't really get outdated, and maps don't lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson.	2	2	2
7597	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water.	1	1	1
7598	3	"The features of the setting in the essay "Rough Road Ahead." affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently, on his journey after following "their advice", reasoning that the men sounded "no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town."" The setting changes from cool to dry and barren with then mention of tumble weeds," and even changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path in the end the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting, and follow his own map from then on."	2	2	2
7599	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is "I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is "This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June "(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)". The hotness and heat had also increased the character's confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is "I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I'd be fine "(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3	3	3
7600	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."	2	1	2
7601	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn't tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That's how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
7602	3	The setting affected the cyclist mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory he felt on twist of many. He was extremely thirsty and there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 build there when the cyclist was a the fock in the road, he thought he could get some water. When this failed the cyclist was even less determined. He felt like the world was against him.	2	2	2
7603	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.	1	1	1
7604	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. "The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips." Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying "About @NUM2 miles" or "Twenty miles up the road." All of this hard work can cause heatstroke & kill him.	2	2	2
7605	3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	2	3	3
7606	3	"In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coheratly as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, an inhabited land. The author says, "There was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind." This emphasizes the characters total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to manuver, especially in such a are state of despair. The setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" greatly impacts the cyclist."	2	3	3
7607	3	There are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narriation says, "and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, "ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.	2	2	2
7608	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, "It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you..."(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn't have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.	1	1	1
7609	3	In ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips," the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, "wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt…, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…" The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite.	2	2	2
7610	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclists has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again.	1	2	2
7611	3	There are many affects of the setting in this eassy that, that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on a empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, no people. In now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the energy. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help. You stock because theirs no one around. Another good thing is that you being by yourself, @CAPS1 any cars. You don't have to worry about getting hit so you'll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride . Another bad thing is there is no water so you might want to bring plenty with you. So whatever you decide to do just be careful and think you idea thought  	1	1	1
7612	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew the was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was their to help him. The environment made him to realize the many risk involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey.	1	1	1
7613	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says "with any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat" when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he "drank deeply from the sink." The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3	3	3
7614	3	In the essay "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks. First, he got information from the old people. For example, when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones. Second, when he ran out of water. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out. Plus when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water come out last, when he finally got to a story the old guy had a map. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said I have my own map. So therefore he knew he was in trouble. In  conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2	2
7615	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, "... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill," By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy and they effected him by taking up all his energy. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist.	1	1	1
7616	3	"In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted  Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affects the cyclist. When at the old codgens house, he is confident in himself, because they have told how of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the settings changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. after ""about @NUM1 miles into te pedal"", the cyclist arrives at the first town, he has despair because it is a ghost town,"" still having confidence, he lack of water, he continues on. after a couple more miles, he comes to small fork with a pump. Thinking its cool, water he goes and pump, he finds out it is @NUM2°@CAPS1 and tastes like ""battery acid"". Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around. When he does find a town, with water, the setting to relieving and better for him because he find water. In the end, the setting effect how the cyclist back against confident, then desperate as water is used, than relieved when water is found."	3	3	3
7617	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly. It's just an overall way setting to give lost in.	1	1	1
7618	3	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldn't cool down it didn't matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.  	1	1	1
7619	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, "This sight was troubling…I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California." With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called "easy way out." 	1	1	1
7620	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on " The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it". At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.	2	1	3
7621	3	The setting of this Essay is to tell cyclest were to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people.	1	1	1
7622	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist, the setting was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, "over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view." He this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water. Also he says, "Summertime "rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain". It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song "summertime" He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also he says, "At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake." He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
7623	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, "That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June." Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says." Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills." Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.	3	3	3
7624	3	"In the essay "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1," the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement "the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them" helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across "one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest make." This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story "The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1." @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay "Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit" is used as an important for character development.  "	3	3	3
7625	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path" it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes" the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke" and when he writes "a ridiculously large snake" show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a tany time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is revelant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is revelant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	2	3
7626	3	The cyclist is faced with many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which is travelling through the California deserts. This was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, plus the author was riding his bike, making  himself more thirsty and hot. He also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills. The biker met the challenges and progressed through them with bravery.	2	2	2
7627	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit" this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying.	1	1	1
7628	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, "flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, "through the high deserts of California in June." This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder.	2	2	2
7629	3	One feature that effected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The  "text states " two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changing…	1	1	1
7630	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. Third, there is not any civilization on the "shortcut" he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	2	2
7631	3	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because is it was windy too it would be had for the cyclist to control the bike. So is  too has a lot as buildings and people outside their would be a lot as traffic so they would not  be allowed to let the cyclist go there so the cyclist would  has to turn back. Then if it was a clear road  and nobody was there ad no bulidings or houses were there then it wold be an easy ride for the cyclist. So as you can see the setting affects the cyclist in many ways.	0	1	1
7632	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct.	2	2	2
7633	3	If it's a good day the cyclist will want to rid. If it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will.	3	3	3
7634	3	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, features of setting affect the cyclist because there is old people that been around for along time and you can't ask for advice because they're to old old to give information and wouldn't know what their talking about. "A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, "Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches sine Carter was in office." That is the features of the setting and examples from the essay.	1	1	1
7635	3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind l'D  war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven't left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.	3	2	3
7636	3	In the story the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost. Had a negative affect on the cyclist, he was doubting himself the whole time. Although he did perserver and made it through the tough situation he was in.	1	1	1
7637	3	In the story "rough road ahead" the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says "I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate". This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage." This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it's a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.	2	2	2
7638	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist's determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.	2	1	2
7639	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. "I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state" This quote proves the dehydration of the rider. "The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke," this quote proves the time and energy of the rider is running out. These ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist.	2	1	2
7640	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn't turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to "set in". The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.	1	2	2
7641	3	The  cyclist  runs  into some pretty tough challenges. The real vies of the setting affected him, because there was so many optical that he had to overcome, for  example, he  got directions  from some old men who move then lively didn't really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpily and he saw snakes. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came  up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch's Grape juice, factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, towards the end he found this fish came where he finally got water and was around people. These different optical affected his mood and how determined he was.	3	2	3
7642	3	The setting in "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit" has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first ‘town' and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it." His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like "rushing" being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. "Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing." At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn't what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, "There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. "This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said "over the long crippling hill, a building came into view." It is at this point that he uses the word "crippling" because he is just about exhausted and can't go any further.	2	2	2
7643	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can't go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.	2	2	2
7644	3	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued withought a building in sight. This made him grow histerical over the situation, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally did see a building he thought it was a mirage.	1	1	1
7645	3	The location of a cyclist's ride affects the person's attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes "It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked "brackish." So, setting can break a cyclist.	2	2	2
7646	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.	1	1	1
7647	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a "shortcut" but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated. This is how the setting affected him.	2	2	2
7648	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.	0	0	0
7649	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled " I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. " This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said " if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time."  	2	1	2
7650	3	The setting of the story had effected the cycle's becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1	1	1
7651	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult.	1	1	1
7652	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said "old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office." This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it." With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.	2	2	2
7653	3	"There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said "Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist."	2	2	2
7654	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, "… I maneuvered down the hill." You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. "When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid…" that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says "…in the??? ???of two hundred degrees." Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite's biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. 	1	1	1
7655	3	There are many things that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said ," tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake." @CAPS1 her example would be when they said" Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7656	3	"The stoy of the cyclist features of the setting affect of the cyclist, The cyclist had to go thoug a lot "" The speed limit was @NUM1. The was doing a water depleting @NUM2, Sometimes life can feel so cruel." The cyclist love ride their bike they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening"" to cycling."	1	1	1
7657	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said "rough road ahead" The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. "the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips." Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or "ghost town". The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park."	2	3	3
7658	3	The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn't on is side that's for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn't want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home.	2	1	2
7659	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, "These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind," If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I'm glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.	2	2	2
7660	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, "That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven't left their porches since Carter was in office". This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven't left their homes in years.	2	2	2
7661	3	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade. "tumbleweeds crossed my path" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This dicride his loneleness because no one was in the desert to help him. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp. The setting had a huge affected on the author.	2	2	2
7662	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips." This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, "and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke" the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, "I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink." This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally.	2	2	2
7663	3	"In "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit", the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist's physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "	3	2	3
7664	3	"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did."	2	2	2
7665	3	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state. "The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so. The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy. Because there was no buildings for miles be broke the ride into short distances	2	1	2
7666	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. Some ways the cyclist was affected is, the lack of water was the biggest problem he had. The group of the old guys that gave him directions werent a big help at all. The men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination. As he begin to get hotter and more thirster into giving up. As soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. He stumbled across water.	2	2	2
7667	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. "Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confine of their porches since carter was in office," (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times.	1	2	2
7668	3	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. "The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down.	1	1	1
7669	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, "The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…" He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn't have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.	3	3	3
7670	3	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Would be that in the setting in the setting affected cyclist because for one the features of setting was based on something else. So that would be a reason how it would be affected. Because they're is differences in the stories.	0	0	0
7671	3	You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.	0	0	0
7672	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and had they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is adised in and how it makes them who they are."	3	2	3
7673	3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills and deal with the factt that has has no water. That's basically what the setting is about.	3	2	3
7674	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story "Do not exceed the speed limit" when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	1	2	2
7675	3	"The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist "arrived at the first ‘town'"" it was deserted, and the water had disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a town "town" having it not really be a town anymore. The large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless lost tone. "	2	2	2
7676	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.	2	1	2
7677	3	"The features of the setting in, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," affect the cyclist in many ways. After following the old mens' advice he sets off on his journey. After the first town appears the sun realy starts to beat down which realy affects the cyclist. In the essay it says "The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it." He @MONTH1 have not noticed it yet but then later on the long winding road on the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is real dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, "The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water- depleting @NUM2." In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, "I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me." This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting. The features of the setting in "Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," affects the cyclist greatly."	2	3	3
7678	3	The terrain setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The fast that he was in a desert made him thirsty. There was no towns any sign of water to quench his thirst. The hills he would dtwepend than heartycle town just  made him moretired. These what the setting did to the cyclist.	1	1	1
7679	3	In the story "Do not exceed posted speed" by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink.	1	1	1
7680	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some eldrerly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just because. First at all, every ""town""and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, would come to, wound up being completely desserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first desserted town he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water town supply, and moved."" @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased.He was then in desperation for a town.On topof thatin the story he wrote, ''the tast roadwas replaced short, rolling hills. ""This made his biking harder and he was then becoming denyarated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men. "	3	3	3
7681	3	"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a "shortcut" to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, "A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first "town" but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, "Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1)." This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about."	2	3	3
7682	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit,"" The time of year affected the cyclist because it's mid June, @CAPS1 the region affected the cyclist because mid June in arizona is extremely hot and try. If it was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or I, ll it wouldn't be as bad and you world not have the dance of a heat struggles. @CAPS1 when the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him the to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."""	1	1	1
7683	3	In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting.	2	2	2
7684	3	In the essay, "Rough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the @CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him.	2	3	3
7685	3	The cyclist is alone traveling on a flat land at first following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June, he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees building which are realy ghost towns he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in a desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map.	3	2	3
7686	3	In the story "Do not exceed posted speed Limit", the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, "haven't left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. "  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the "Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite"' he was traveling through a barren desert. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." This type of setting could really bring down a cultist's mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better.	1	1	1
7687	3	"The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. "over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view." The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me."	2	3	3
7688	3	"Do not exceed posted speed limit", is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this "old" shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story for example when the bicyclist came to a deserted area he said "there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind". By this time he was malnourished & in need of water this extreme thrist also reselted in him passing an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory with an advertisement with a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice in his mouth. He says "In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,", then he goes into detail about the building, this mood & feeling by this time was tired and worn out and the advertisement didn't help the situation at all. The authors mood did change with the setting and before it got better it was worse.	3	2	3
7689	3	"The young cycolist began his day confident in looking forward to his day of riding across california, slowly, however as he recognizes his been directed wrongly, his mood changes,& he begins to feel more hopless. AS he begins, he feels carefree & mody for anything. He writes ""I checked, checked my water supply & moved on. The sun was beginning to heat down, not I barely noticed it. The surroundings have little effect on him. Later, on he realizes his water was going down, & he is getting tired, his mood changed to exhaustion & defect. Here he writes "i got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles & stuch them in my mouth with any luck I'd hit a bump of lodge one in my throat." He has become sarcastic of saddened by the hoplessness of his journey. Eventually, he had relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits & sense of humor"	3	3	3
7690	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man's place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2	2	2
7691	3	Weather, places, the will to continue – all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal. The sunny hot weather will affect his will to ride.  I mean come on who wants to ride when its burning hot outside the places the cyclist went through like towns and rough roads would affect him because it's pretty tough.	1	2	2
7692	3	The story "Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit " tells of a biking trip gone wrong. But the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happend in a different place. The setting plays a large role in the story. The story begins on a present summer evening but as the man bikes he arrives at ghost town devold of evil life, later feeling of double sets In when he arrives at "one ramshockle shed, severall rusty pumps and a corrol that couldn't hold these lamest mule. " later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. Like an cold wesstern. Finally all  hope is lost when he reaches these grapes Juice factory and fInd, "a sand blasted picture of a Young boy, " The setting is a power full tool which greatly influences the cyclist.  	2	2	2
7693	3	"In the story, "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected they cyclists physical abilities. The features affected is abilities, because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough 'Since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is,". Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination, because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much @NUM1 to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops,"".distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I'd be fine." In the story,"" Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities"	2	3	3
7694	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel." @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. "I could make that!" But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don't make it. "It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean." It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists."	3	2	3
7695	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills. It was a hot day in June and he had a sparse water supply with him. He was peddling through the desert's of California. The last thing that effected him was that there wasn't very many places to stop for water.	1	1	1
7696	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremly out of date and haven't left their pourch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. One his journey the cyclist says "…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isn't any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a	2	2	2
7697	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him.	2	2	2
7698	3	The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, "Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills" (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills don't help any eigther.	2	1	2
7699	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn't have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch's Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a "young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth" This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.	1	1	1
7700	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. "Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. "This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. "Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me" This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3	3	3
7701	3	It give him a hard time so he learn a lot of thing from that he know that it not always easy. It not abig problem but sometime some small problem become bigger life is like riding bike you have any down some time have problem sometimes lost but that is life.	0	0	0
7702	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."  He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, "Flat road was replace by short, rolling hills." I believe riding over these hills in the hot @DATE1 in a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist. I believe the terrain very much affected him.	2	3	3
7703	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the "… high   deserts of California… "   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the "Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills "   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   "… long, crippling hill… " (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
7704	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, "I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."  	2	2	2
7705	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says "Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.	1	1	1
7706	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says he's in Lodi, California on a "gorgeous day in June." It's very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist.	1	2	2
7707	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, "over one crippling hills…" with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn't careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he'll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water."	2	2	2
7708	3	The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. 	2	3	3
