6379	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. ""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."	3	2	3
6380	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist.	1	1	1
6381	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3	3
6382	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1	1	1
6383	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, “short, rolling hills”, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn’t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2	2
6384	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.	2	3	3
6385	3	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn’t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist “as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.	1	2	2
6386	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “ From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2	2
6387	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.	3	3	3
6388	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3	2	3
6389	3	The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This could also cause a problem because he can’t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can’t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day.	2	2	2
6390	3	The cyclist in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can’t do anything. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier.	1	2	2
6391	3	The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the “town.” The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist.	1	1	1
6392	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He also says, “Over one long, crippling hill.” As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3	3	3
6393	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn’t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road.	1	1	1
6394	3	He race trying to get yosemitre for some rushing river	1	1	1
6395	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don’t know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6396	3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the “old timers” he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  	3	3	3
6397	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” The feautures of the of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him.	2	2	2
6398	3	"In the story the cyclist is affect by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He’s also running low on water,“The water bottles only contained & few tantalizing sips.” He’s faced by extrem heat and lack of water. He’s tired and has a long way to go. So far, all of the towns have been deserted. Finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future."	2	2	2
6399	3	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways. For example, the couse must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	1	2
6400	3	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says “their were no cars nor buildings in sight” that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an “oldtimer” asks if he knows the best way to go.	2	2	2
6401	3	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it’s June and that causes alot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afaid of getting dihydrated. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was lossing my water.	2	2	2
6402	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first “town”, he could tell there’d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water.	2	2	2
6403	3	I think it explains because they did good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did same thing worng to.	0	0	0
6404	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead : Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,”  by Joe Kurmaskie”  the features of the setting affects the cyclist. Dehydration caused by heat could not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and to feel nautious. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh. In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in an bad state. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	0	1
6405	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3	3
6406	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. “The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. “The high deserts of California in June.” “l could drop from a heatstroke.” The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up. The have of animals “ There was No- one in sight.” It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if store or people would have been around, @CAPS2 exact is the animals. “A @CAPS3 large   snake crossed my path.” “diamondback- blocked the majoritly of the pavement. It would have been to worry about those things these are all things that affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6407	3	Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.	2	2	2
6408	3	"In the case of thr cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he “had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. “@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, “somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; “there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne."	3	3	3
6409	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2	2
6410	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first “town” that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist “chuckled and moved on”, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3	3
6411	3	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down like if it was cold or hot outside it can slow the person down. If the person does not	1	1	1
6412	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1	1
6413	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.	2	2	2
6414	3	Setting can affect a cyclsit in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehidrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisnous snakes. The cycclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling of his bike, dehidration, and a bite form snake. Say ??? in the mountains of ???.There are many problems that face you there.	1	1	1
6415	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, “Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.” For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, “A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, “Sometimes life can feelso cruel. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist.	2	1	2
6416	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of there water because it was hot and they would get ??  thirsty from all of that ???	1	1	1
6417	3	"In the essay intitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood."	3	3	3
6418	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, “…@CAPS1 blues tune ‘summer time’ rattled around in…my deteriorating brain.” The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It’s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it’s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, “…haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 	2	2	2
6419	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist’s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, “with strong legs and a smile on my face”. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. “At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3	3	3
6420	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough bumby dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and nort or even kill him. Since he had no water he was de hydrating. Also the road was hot very well taken care of it took more energy to get through it.	1	1	1
6421	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1	1
6422	3	The cyclist is out in the desert there for was tired & also running out of water so hes getting dehydrated. 	1	1	1
6423	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the strat he had can eidance which died once he got into the barren dessert but picked up when  he round a rest stop. A prime example to how he started leds and a smile on my face “to” and the growing realization that I could dropping heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June becaused listen to some gentelmen who hadn’t been off their perch in decades “ to” I had an over welming urse to seek out Gary and wilber kiss them and buy some bait. “ The over all mood ox the story is based off how the authour feels.	2	3	3
6424	3	The features of the setting in this story, “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,” affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.  	2	2	2
6425	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. “I maneuvered down the hill.” This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.	2	1	2
6426	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply.The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising.  The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The author’s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it."	1	2	2
6427	3	"In the start story “Do not exceed speed limit,” time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist’s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author)"	1	1	1
6428	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.	1	2	2
6429	3	Don’t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park. Takes a status that would out home off side. Forty miles into the trys comes to a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say “the water taste like buttery acid. Lead going to hills and azyl towns, @CAPS1 can be rod without anything to drink. People die  from heatatacks because they don’t  sits and take herats for water and food.	1	1	1
6430	3	Features in the setting of the cyclist does in fact affect him in many ways. The setting in the passage include features like, no one to be seen, no buildings, dirty, bumpsy terrain, hot weather and plenty of vegetation. All these features affect the cyclist in negative ways. For instance, the dry weather affects the human body with dehydration which the cyclist is affected by.	1	1	1
6431	3	The setting in the story affect the cyclist alot. It is June in the California desert. The sun is heating down on him. Another problem that he faces is that there is a very rough terrain. All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster. The setting is making him feel very disprate when is even worse.	1	1	1
6432	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1’@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn’t want lose the battle in his mind.   	2	3	3
6433	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would’ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.	2	1	2
6434	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us “…I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.” The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  “towns” were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map."	2	2	2
6435	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said “ I got down on my hands working the hande of the rusted water pump with all my strength” that shows desperation due to the lack of water.	1	1	1
6436	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         	2	1	2
6437	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was “some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" Then the terrain in changes when he says “Flat road was replaced "	1	2	2
6438	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or were it says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. They are trying to say is that, you do what they say you are going to be mesem peoples travel will not work, so make the right choice and do the right thing.	1	1	1
6439	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located. 	1	1	1
6440	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was “losing hope”. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn’t help, but the second man did.	1	1	1
6441	3	"In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it say this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, “one ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he’s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think it’s the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like it’s among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder."	3	2	3
6442	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty. He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong, because if you have an ascedent that nobody would be there to help. Hes going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful.	1	1	1
6443	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, If you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn’t sweat as much and wouldn’t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps,wide cings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realizating that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear…and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways.	2	2	2
6444	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s “town” was now abandoned. “…(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When “a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3	3
6445	3	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured “town” he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake –“tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3	3	3
6446	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2	3	3
6447	3	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. WHILE THE HILLS WERE FLAT THE CYCLIST WAS DETERMINED HE COULD MAKE IT AND WASN’T GOING TO GIVE UP ON HIMSELF. WHEN THE HILLS GOT BIGGER AND HARDER TO PEDAI, HE BEGAN TO GET EXHAUSTED AND TIRED. LASTLY, THE BUILDINGS WERE WHAT MADE HIM WANT TO GIVE UP. WHEN HE SEES THE BUILDING OF THE WELCH’S GRAPE JUICE FACTORY AND THE YOUNG BOY DRINKING HE “HUNG HIS HEAD.” HE WAS GETTING MORE TIRED AS HE WENT ALONG. THE LAND WAS MAKING HIM FEEL AS IF HE DIDN’T WANT TO KEEP MOVING ALONG.	2	2	2
6448	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the “ghost town” and bait shop he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 	2	2	2
6449	3	It think  it means  to be all you can be.	0	0	0
6450	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 	2	2	2
6451	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water.	1	1	1
6452	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don’t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.	1	1	1
6453	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6454	3	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.	2	2	2
6455	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. "	2	3	3
6456	3	The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
6457	3	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.	2	2	2
6458	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn’t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad.	1	1	1
6459	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don’t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that’s his problem.	2	2	2
6460	3	"In the @CAPS1 ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud its anything town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states."" I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June."" this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text."" I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,"" on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town."" This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist."	2	2	2
6461	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.	2	2	2
6462	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn’t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3	3	3
6463	3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. “… I could drop from heatstroke…” he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. “…look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement…” It could have easily killed him, if he wasn’t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over.	3	3	3
6464	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn’t seen the land in a really long time. The man don’t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn’t know what to do.  	1	1	1
6465	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 	2	2	2
6466	3	The cyclist in ”Rough road Ahead” was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it’s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn’t an easy trick.	1	2	2
6467	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says “the bulding abandoned years earlier.” If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1	1
6468	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist’s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author wouldn’t have been so dehydrated if it weren’t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn’t have been any conflicts.	2	2	2
6469	3	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didn’t know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there. 	1	1	1
6470	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him” no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen “One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2	2
6471	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it’s very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.	1	1	1
6472	3	In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.”The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, “One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.”there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3	3	3
6473	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6474	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn’t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2	2
6475	3	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn’t go to fast or he’s tire’s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.	1	1	1
6476	3	"The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions"	3	2	3
6477	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren’t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. There were rusted water pump’s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2	2
6478	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3	3	3
6479	3	I really thought the story didn’t make sense the setting was crazy I really wasn’t feeling it at all I don’t think it was even a good story	0	0	0
6480	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.” and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don’t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.	2	2	2
6481	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1	1
6482	3	The trees were in the landscape and it was making the colors red and the volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered were in the landscape and milker years ago it make the swampland became the desert	1	1	1
6483	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement “I was travelling in June.” @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid.” This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3	3	3
6484	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3	3
6485	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way.	3	3	3
6486	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through.	2	2	2
6487	3	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted.	2	3	3
6488	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn’t have much water. In the text it says “I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.” The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn’t able to drink much because he had limited water.	1	1	1
6489	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn’t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.	2	2	2
6490	3	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm.	1	1	1
6491	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch’s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the “shortcut.” “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, “ By the looks of it- had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  	3	3	3
6492	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist’s mood in a negative way.  	2	2	2
6493	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,” At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2	2
6494	3	Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings.	2	3	3
6495	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay “A sea worry “, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says “my son body-surfs. He says it’s his “job”. That quote was explaining that he’s a body-surfer & it’s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2	2
6496	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a “dehydrated state” because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.	1	1	1
6497	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, “I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).” This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says “I toiled on( @CAPS2).” This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.	2	2	2
6498	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty. Than him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn’t get any water. The hills made him tired and weak. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty.	1	2	2
6499	3	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water. That is a feature that affects the cyclist	1	1	1
6500	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1	2
6501	3	The setting of the place was “ghost town” as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn’t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1	1
6502	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers” This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map.  	2	2	2
6503	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said “Drop from heatstroke.” this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.	2	1	2
6504	3	The features of the setting affected the author’s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says “over one long, crippling hill.” This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn’t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point.	1	1	1
6505	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche’s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men.	3	3	3
6506	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1	1
6507	3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay.	3	3	3
6508	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “ things began well enough.” @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.	2	2	2
6509	3	"The cyclist is effected by the setting in “Rough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, its a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text it said , “over a long crippling hill,” the crippiling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill."	1	1	1
6510	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2	1	2
6511	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2	2
6512	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can‘t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3	3
6513	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his “shortcut” his running out of water. That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.	2	2	2
6514	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
6515	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.	1	1	1
6516	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn’t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the “high deserts of colifornia in June” I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back” That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to “ease post” it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was “replaced by short, rolling hills” which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3	3
6517	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1	1
6518	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn’t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6519	3	"First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water."	2	2	2
6520	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he’d be better off using his map.	2	1	2
6521	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn’t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6522	3	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine.	2	2	2
6523	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in “the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.	2	2	2
6524	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go.	2	2	2
6525	3	The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.	2	2	2
6526	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.”	1	1	1
6527	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn’t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.	2	2	2
6528	3	"The setting really afeted the cyclist alot.The sun and hot weather dehidrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says ""the growing relization that I could drop from a leaf stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him."	2	2	2
6529	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him.	2	2	2
6530	3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn’t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few “tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,” By the lols of it had been a Welch’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.” He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a “Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.	3	2	3
6531	3	I read “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office”	1	1	1
6532	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2	3	3
6533	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.” I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he “toiled” on, the terrain features became even more trying,” over one long, crippling hill…”By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.	2	2	2
6534	3	The settings to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is an alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, ‘Rough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.” He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting an a really athletic ride can be devastating. 	1	1	1
6535	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn’t that good. There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up. There’re some interesting sence in the story.	2	2	2
6536	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. If you arn’t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2	2
6537	3	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him.	1	1	1
6538	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when you have hills to climb and little water, you will get dehydrated. Also the heat from the desert is so hot that it also can make you dehydrated. If you don’t  pace yourself and dont drink too much water you will be able to reach your goal. Your rest is a big thing for if you dont have energy, you will not get far.	0	0	0
6539	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was afraid of the grass becase it was tall and scary looking.	1	1	1
6540	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit” a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2	2
6541	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. 	2	2	2
6542	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the ‘ramshackle shed’ the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every ‘shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot."	2	2	2
6543	3	The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story & stuck it out & made it to the end.	3	2	3
6544	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns – all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on.	2	2	2
6545	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  “Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie 	1	1	1
6546	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author tells a story about when he took advice from “old folks” and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example “tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake…” and a “crippling hill” these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.	1	1	1
6547	3	He’s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He’s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can’t find any towns that aren’t abandoned.	2	2	2
6548	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the road he had to go slower so took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thristy and the water was really hot.	1	1	1
6549	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived. 	1	1	1
6550	3	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.	1	1	1
6551	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.	2	2	2
6552	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haven’th confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1	1	1
6553	3	"Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is “tarlike” and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn’t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist."	2	2	2
6554	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat “beginning to beat down” on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.	3	2	3
6555	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didn’t know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.	1	1	1
6556	3	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. It was very hot and he had a scares supply of water. He was seeing things that wasn’t there. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot.	1	1	1
6557	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. 	1	1	1
6558	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said ‘’ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,’’ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1	1
6559	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2	2
6560	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven’t left there porches since carter was in office. After that because you don’t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office. I don’t know why people have not left there porches since carter was in office.	1	1	1
6561	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.” This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2	2
6562	3	In “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie: c, I think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. Also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. Thats how I think the setting affectd him.    	1	1	1
6563	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3	3
6564	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don’t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you’re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “town” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don’t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.” l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he’d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.  	3	3	3
6565	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.” He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.	1	1	1
6566	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3	2	3
6567	3	In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. “The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips.” he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. “At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond back–bloked the majority of the pavement.” It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.	1	1	1
6568	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn’t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1	1
6569	3	In the cyclist’s outlook on his journey through Yosemite’s park, reader’s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1	1
6570	3	The features oF the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. In this cass the outhor says “The sun was beating down on me”. The author is hot From the sun. He says “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. He is showing how he hasno water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water.  	2	2	2
6571	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.	2	2	2
6572	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3	2	3
6573	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, first is that it is very hot in the desert. Second is that there aren’t many towns out there. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he get thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn’t find a town.	1	1	1
6575	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3	2	3
6576	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2	2
6577	3	"The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow do keep from dehydration. If the cyclist in,”Do Not Exceed Posted  Speed Limit"", was cycling in winter time, he would of been so thirsty all of the time. Also if the whole ride was down hill, he would be so tired,"	1	1	1
6578	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3	2	3
6579	3	"The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can’t walk. But that is where self–determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don’t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can ‘t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2	2
6580	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2	2
