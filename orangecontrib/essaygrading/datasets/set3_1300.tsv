6980	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, "They'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1	1
6981	3	In the story "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit "the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 "old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office". These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn't have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2	2
6982	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch's Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.   	3	2	3
6983	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.	1	1	1
6984	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1	1
6985	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1	1
6986	3	"The setting in the short story; "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit" greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, "Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…" this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can't think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist."	2	3	3
6987	3	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been.	1	1	1
6988	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean." If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don't think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2	2
6989	3	"In the essay, "Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, "one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling", this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, "The sun was beginning to beat down", and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a "modernized" town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2	3
6990	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1	1
6991	3	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states "ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me." If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated "I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June…" There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.	1	1	1
6992	3	In Joe Kurmaskie's, "Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" there are several features that effect the cyclist. "..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June" (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist. These conditions directly affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
6993	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1	1
6994	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated "I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1". Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages "A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.	1	1	1
6995	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph" That site ment that the old man's sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1	1
6996	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.	2	2	2
6997	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist's mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, "traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean." Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2	2	2
6998	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.	1	1	1
6999	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!	1	1	1
7000	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he "was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A "ghost town" with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.	2	2	2
7001	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the "ghost town" he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him. 	2	2	2
7002	3	In the story "Do not exceed posted speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. "tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state." This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well.	2	2	2
7003	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first "town" he found he described as a "ghost town" It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn't helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey "a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? "which  ?? him it could have ?? The features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways	3	2	3
7004	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1	2
7005	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1	1
7006	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.	1	1	1
7007	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." @CAPS1 he makes note that he's only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he'd be okay, but he regretted it later on"	2	2	2
7008	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were "I was going to die." First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber's Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1	1
7009	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He's biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It's not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he's doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired.	1	1	1
7010	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the ‘high deserts of California in June." The cyclist also saw a "ridiculously large snake." There was also no signs of civilization for miles." There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1	1
7011	3	Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat and hills on the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps going through, and eventually he gets to civilization. This lets you know that you can't mother nature control you.	1	1	1
7012	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He "was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.	1	1	1
7013	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted "I toiledon" he sounds like it's hopeless, that he wasn't going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.	1	1	1
7014	3	The setting of "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. "I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn't know how else to get some water	1	1	1
7015	3	"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite."	1	2	2
7016	3	"The setting in the story "Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it's a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he's lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1	1
7017	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good "it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1". I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I'm going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said "the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is becasse he soid ""As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me the part made me feel.  "	1	2	2
7018	3	In the story "Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes "that road was replaced by short, rolling hills" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels "life can feel so cruel" (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist.	1	2	2
7019	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man's place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2	2
7020	3	In the story, "Do not exceed posted speed limit", there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, "The sun was beginning to beat down", the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, "I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June", California's temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. 	2	3	3
7021	3	In the short story "Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ," The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in "the high deserts of California in June " .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey .	2	3	3
7022	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he's drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2	2
7023	3	In the poem "Do not exceed speed limit" the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says "At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake" This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read "Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit" this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1	1
7024	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0	0
7025	3	The setting in "Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits" affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the "cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite." @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on "there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land." At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.	2	2	2
7026	3	The setting in the essay "Rough Road Ahead" makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the "flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills," the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was "traveling through the high desert of California in June" this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2	3	3
7027	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn't so hot, then he wouldn't of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn't help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3	3
7028	3	The setting in the story "Do not exceed posted speed limit" affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that "there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he's going to die. He shows that he's lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from "old-timers who haven't left their porches since Carter was in office." In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3	2	3
7029	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles "battery acid." The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, "sometimes life can feel so cruel," which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.	2	2	2
7030	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. "... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees". This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1	1
7031	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn't what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1	1
7032	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said" I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine," By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.	2	2	2
7033	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it's nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He's excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch's Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3	3
7034	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling ." The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging," In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen." For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    	3	2	3
7035	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That's so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him.	2	2	2
7036	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn't even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach "rough roads" creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait "tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.	3	3	3
7037	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.	1	1	1
7038	3	"There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind". This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. "I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2	2
7039	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.	1	1	1
7040	3	The features of the setting in the essay, "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit" affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as "a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening." The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, "The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large" snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite." @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn't give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3	3
7041	3	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speaker's determination did too, "Flat road were replaced by short hills". The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. "I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades". The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. "I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst",. But the bumpy terrain didn't allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean". But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much.	2	2	2
7042	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his "shortcut" he was in great doubt of his survival. "I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean." He thought he wouldn't get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. "And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke."	2	2	2
7043	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, "The sun was beginning to heat down" (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June" (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it's warmer months. The terrain didn't favor in the riders either "Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills "(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.	2	2	2
7044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.	1	1	1
7045	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through.	1	1	1
7046	3	The features of the setting in this story gives the cyclist determination. Since the desert	1	1	1
7047	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn't have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn't in a "ghost town", with the, "sun beggining to beat down". It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, "about forty miles into the petal", causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2	2
7048	3	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.	1	1	1
7049	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired. 	2	1	2
7050	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for "rough road ahead," @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3	3	3
7051	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they're water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1	1
7052	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
7053	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June" (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, "A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn't have much to drink until the next town. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills" (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills "A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen" (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2	3
7054	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn't have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn't have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn't conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn't get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn't really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don't help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2	3
7055	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.	1	1	1
7056	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit," I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,"water-deplating" one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as "rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator's hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3	3
7057	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2	2
7058	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1	1
7059	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in "high desert of California in June." This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3	3
7060	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn't get any water. "I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst," he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, "The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke," it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy.	1	1	1
7061	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh turane proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achive the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
7062	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1	1
7063	3	The setting desented in the story, "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit," would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer's day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, "wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke" (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.	2	2	2
7064	3	The desert area of California was makeing him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get him there only if he took the maps way. The old men thot "haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office" told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map he could have stoped off at a store for more water if the setting was that bad.	1	1	1
7065	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , "like a foolish yuuth," folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and "in an ironic twist" he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: "Gary and Wilber's Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we're your best bet " in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who "haven't left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office"	3	3	3
7066	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say "old timers who haven't lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office" that what he is explaining. He then say "I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face" he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did "He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't mirage and tried not get to excited" @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2	2
7067	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says "haven't gotten off there porches since carter was in office." I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1	1
7068	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1	2
7069	3	The features in the setting in the story "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like "battery acid". Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed.	2	2	2
7070	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1	1
7071	3	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can't find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey.	1	1	1
7072	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts "Do not exceed posted speed limit "is after "wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June". This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. "a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.  	2	1	2
7073	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, "by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, "@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!" Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.	2	2	2
7074	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. 	1	1	1
7075	3	"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, "Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as "the high deserts of California in June." He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."	3	3	3
7076	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it's too hot, you're going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it's all down hill, it's really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist	2	1	2
7077	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals. The text states,	2	2	2
7078	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through "high deserts in @LOCATION1" where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and maneuver his way down. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down he will need water but is already low.	1	1	1
7079	3	"In the story "Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel." In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he's at risk of running out. Not only that but he's been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,." I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades." So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "	3	2	3
7080	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that's not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. "Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, "trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2	2
7081	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike.	2	1	2
7082	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says "About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.' This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town." This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was "going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch's factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist	3	2	3
7083	3	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that "don't remember the saying don't take candy from strangers." So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it's wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that "the old man hasn't been off his porch since Carter was in office," so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude.	1	1	1
7084	3	In the story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldn't make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. Because of the rolling hills and snakes he didn't think he would make it any where and thought he was going to die. That's how the setting affected the character.	1	1	1
7085	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the "shortcut" there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn't make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could	3	3	3
7086	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.	1	1	1
7087	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn't take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.	3	2	3
7088	3	The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles. He could have died. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said " There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in California.	2	2	2
7089	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, thus a very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the "old-timers" by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, "what I shouldn't have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, "The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips." @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn't anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, "There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind." By reading this story, we've realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed"	1	1	1
7090	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don't find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1	1
7091	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal.	1	1	1
7092	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can't tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California "I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June" The effect on his body would be rather devastating.	1	1	1
7093	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1	1
7094	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example "One long, crippling hill" I can picture it in my head. "There was no one in sight." All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.	1	1	1
7095	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the "rolling hills" @MONTH1 let the rider get more tired. Another way is that of water from severe heat. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go.	2	2	2
7096	3	The setting in the story "Do not exceed posted speed limit" reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says "Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left their porches since carter was in office."(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers "shortcut" and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says "Yes, sir! I own a very good map," and "I'd always stick to it in the future." The cyclist's message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2	2
7097	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and rough road with plenty of hills to make it hard for a bike to out come. he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him.	2	1	2
7098	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.	2	2	2
7099	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist's mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, "Things began well enough… flat roads…" This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a "smile on the face." (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, "…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills." This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next "town". Finally, when the author reaches "Gary & Wilber's fish camp" he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, "know The best way to get There? "Yes sir! I own a very good map." This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude.	2	2	2
7100	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert it is in the summer. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to git dehyjradid.	1	1	1
7101	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn't feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1	1
7102	3	After sometime into his trip he mentioned "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California.	1	1	1
7103	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn't have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would've died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don't use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.	1	2	2
7104	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he's doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he's looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June" when he sees that he panics and thinks he's not gonna make it which affects him mentally.	1	1	1
7105	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake "At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback" (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasn't there.	1	1	1
7106	3	"He was affected by lack of water, the hills, snake in the way and the condition of the road." The water bottles contained only a  few tantalizing sips. " This quote explains how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him by they were "crippling"". The snake it was long ways on the road and he didn't know how to get passed it . Finally the   roads were rough and you should go  over the speed limit of 55 mph. So he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one."	2	1	2
7107	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes "ghost towns," "abandoned buildings," and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of "dropping" dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing "what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he'll surely abide by: follow the map!"	3	3	3
7108	3	The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had "wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt," and he could "drop from heatstroke." The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldn't have been as affected by the setting.	1	1	1
7109	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. "I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate." This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.   	1	1	1
7110	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said "…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said "…I could drop from heatstroke…" If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger.	2	2	2
7111	3	The cyclist's features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through "the high deserts of California in June" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had "A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states "Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    	3	3	3
7112	3	The setting affects the cyclist because there were lots of hills and very little water.	1	1	1
7113	3	The cyclist in the story rough road ahead Do not exeed posted speed limit, by Joe kurmashie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the ‘shorecay' that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: ‘It really didn't matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.' This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.	2	2	2
7114	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie. One feature that affected the character was the heat of the sun. The narration states" The sun was beginning to beat down" (@CAPS1).	1	1	1
7115	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit". In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist."	3	2	3
7116	3	In the essay "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said "It tasted like battery acide." To me if the water is hot don't taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could.	3	2	3
7117	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn't get water. It is so hot out there that he couldn't see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.	1	1	1
7118	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit " the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically, when the setting was nice he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, and more treaterous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed.	1	1	1
7119	3	A cyclist always has to face many problems such as the weather, the condition of the road, etc.	1	1	1
7120	3	The features in the setting, affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was desearted leaving him alone with no water. In the story it says "This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war – but on that morning it fit the traditional defination of a ghost town, "this explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was deserted. The next example of how the features and the settings	2	3	3
7121	3	The featers of the setting afected the cyclist by the lack of water made him tiered and a bit deloshional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehidrashion. The rough road made it hard to balinc. And the snack slowed him dowen. He thought that he was going to die.	1	2	2
7122	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."	2	2	2
7123	3	The setting is in a California which isn't really the coolest of places to be.[temperature]	1	1	1
7124	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment. He says, "I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening." At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. "this sight was trowoling". The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. "flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist."	2	3	3
7125	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life's can feel so cruel."" The cyclist's surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but even tually he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners, and kiss them."	3	3	3
7126	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me." So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn't help him much.  	3	2	3
7127	3	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists' brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists' travel much harder.	2	1	2
7128	3	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, "A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, "Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways.	1	2	2
7129	3	"The setting of the essay "Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a "short cut"" from so he do me through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence. "Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face." With this he arrives at the first "town" but hes wasn't worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit." This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions."	3	3	3
7130	3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation.	3	3	3
7131	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1'l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn't. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn't have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It's easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 	2	3	3
7132	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike "through the high deserts of California in June, make the intensity level of the story very high. If it would have been @DATE1 and there was a nice breeze it would be different.	1	1	1
7133	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.	2	2	2
7134	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it's hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don't  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.	1	1	1
7135	3	 The story "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don't need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first "town," I don't think "into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything.	1	1	1
7136	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is, the setting. The cyclist is out in the dessert, in two-hundred degree weather. With very little water. Also, the cyclist didn`t have a map and he asked someone that hasn`t let their porch since carter was in office. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.'' This quote talks about how the setting (@NUM1 degree weather, dessert) can @CAPS1 him. Also, he listened to someone that didn`t know what they were talking about. In conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2	2
7137	3	The settings of the story is very desert like what I mean by that is its the desert and its hot and he really had to push his self to make it. The condition at the rode are very rough and has a lotof shape turn it in. Apart in the story he gets a boost of energy and pedal as hard as he can down a hill and then relaxes. This is the setting and is summary of the story.	0	0	0
7138	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the hills. There were no cars, building, smog, just nature. It was peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike thats the setting affects the cyclist.	1	1	1
7139	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.	3	3	3
7140	3	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it. He took advice from old people to do it. But even though it started out good almost nothing last forever. Hes riding a like in the middle of summer with little water and in the desert. He runs into towns that are abandon and the next town is only @NUM1 miles are litheraly going to be rough roads ahead. But when he did get to the town that was abandon to. until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair 	2	2	2
7141	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about "old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."	1	1	1
7142	3	In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasn't true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist	2	2	2
7143	3	The setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map. He should have packed an extra bottle of water. @NUM1 not take any advice from people that haven't left the porch in years.	2	1	2
7144	3	The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. "I could make that" he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, "I was sad". Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood.	2	3	3
7145	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1	1	1
7146	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town "I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.' This quote means that he wasn't expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features.	2	1	2
7147	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water "to feel sorry for himself" The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to "rolling hills". This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2	3
7148	3	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says "The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them." The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didn't even realize the heat.	1	1	1
7149	3	"In the short story, "Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit," by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, "It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom." The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, "And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait." The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people's sense of directions."	3	3	3
7150	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1	1
7151	3	The setting in the story was the "high deserts of California in June." At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn't make it he saw a sign that said "Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp" He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage" and "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean" So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3	3	3
7152	3	The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don't have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.	1	1	1
7153	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn't get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake." They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted "I eased past." When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist's journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other "GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we're your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."	3	3	3
7154	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, "I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, "over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."	3	3	3
7155	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden't gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn't get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3	3
7156	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.	1	1	1
7157	3	The setting of the cyclist's journey effected him because if he was a tot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike throug it and he heat took a lot out of him. He didn't have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.	2	2	2
7158	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips." Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. "Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills." The rider didn't think he would live "I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean" but he found a place to get water "drank deeply from the sink" and finished his ride."	2	2	2
7159	3	In the story "Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, "Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn't have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3	3
7160	3	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can't and they shouldn't do this or that such as the sign of "no entering" or "one way". Second, it's limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn't travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of "Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit". Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  	1	1	1
7161	3	 The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they doubt or lessen his chances for survival, but the cyclist is determined so he survives.	3	2	3
7162	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch's grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2	2
7163	3	No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn't doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn't know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing.	2	2	2
7164	3	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it tells about a cyclists challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won't help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn't need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that's just unhealthy	2	2	2
7165	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.	3	2	3
7166	3	The features of the setting inhance the cyclist's desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as "Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant" which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2	2
7167	3	"In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says "This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly "(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn't going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."	2	3	3
7168	3	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.	1	1	1
7169	3	"The features of the setting, in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth". This made him hang his head as he rode on. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	1	2
7170	3	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story "As worry" because the authors son suffs a lot. And it shows what he and his friends @MONTH1 look like. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing there surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second are only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing. So in conclusion the first photograph is moreaccurate to the story than the second photo.	1	1	1
7171	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. "one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me." It's only him." At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions.	1	2	2
7172	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist	2	2	2
7173	3	The cyclist in "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn't quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn't been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch's juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.	2	3	3
7174	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert's feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty."	3	2	3
7175	3	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story "@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit the rider runs into" a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road	2	2	2
7176	3	In the story, "Do not exceed posted speed limit", the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.	1	1	1
7177	3	The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don't have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote "I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June," tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It s twice as hot during the summer.	3	0	2
7178	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office," this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist.	1	1	1
7179	3	In the essay intitled "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to "Yosemite" and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says "Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office." @CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said "Rough	1	1	1
7180	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.	1	1	1
7181	3	"In the essay "Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. The setting and the features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no watter. This caused him to become tired and frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign "Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp" he started to regain hope and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically, but mentally as well. He started of determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful."	3	2	3
7182	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, "there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind." This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, "One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me." You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, "battery acid," that he wouldn't last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1	1
7183	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a "ramshackle shed" surrounded by "several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lames mule", he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can't make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit". Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says "sometimes life can be so cruel" as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn't believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation "should please all sadists" reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.	3	3	3
7184	3	In the essay "Do Not Exceed Speed Limit," the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn't stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn't know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn't working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn't cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	2	2
7185	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist."	3	3	3
7186	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, "…but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst…" This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.	2	2	2
7187	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. "and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June." The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. "I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips." The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor.	3	3	3
7188	3	According to the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.	3	2	3
7189	3	The fatures of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather for example when he said "wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt" this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagton what the character Is going through because everything is written in details.	1	1	1
7190	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to "@CAPS1 National Park". He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a "town", which was, to him, considered a ghost town. Then he got to a Welch's Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, "Know the best way to get there?" The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man "yes, sir: I own a very good map". The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again.	1	1	1
7191	3	In the essay "Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit" the setting affected the cyclist sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there but the old men told him their "short-cut." It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from "old-timers that hadn't left their porches since Carter was in office." That is how the setting affected the cyclist in the's essay.	1	1	1
7192	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.	0	0	0
7193	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks – are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example "Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit." This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.	1	1	1
7194	3	What l believe that the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that, "The old guys in the story remember things back how they used to be bot as they say in the book the world iso fluid place things change all the time. So for the cyclist to find his way he had to try and put together the the piece the old guys gave him.	1	1	1
7195	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because you wouldn't put the sitting in rain or he wouldn't be ride the bike. Anther one is you wouldn't have a the sitting a city when there is nothing around but trees and rivers.	1	1	1
7196	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, hopless but still had energy to feel himself.	2	2	2
7197	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won't try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 	2	3	3
7198	3	The setting in the short story "Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist "One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the tamest mule greeted me," made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere. The quote, "Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills," shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist.	2	2	2
7199	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.	1	1	1
7200	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, "flat road was replaced by short rolling hills"(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist's idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud.	2	2	2
7201	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.	1	1	1
7202	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon "one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps" no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew "travelling through the high deserts of California in June" his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to "the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite" would be to devastating	1	2	2
7203	3	The setting affects the rider because it is very hot wich makes him thirsty. how long the road witch affect his mind state and last the fact that ??? is in sight and that affect is coral	1	1	1
7204	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist's mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay "Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon" The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps" This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could't drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch‘s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay "Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting's features."	3	2	3
7205	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.	1	1	1
7206	3	Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, "I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June." @CAPS1 that California is called, "the sunshine state", I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
7207	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.	1	1	1
7208	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he rode through the heat scorching desert of California, he rode over @NUM1 miles on bike to get to Yosemite, and he almost ran out of water on the journey. What kept him going on was the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.	1	1	1
7209	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the "short cut" that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, "I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.	3	2	3
7210	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time.	2	2	2
7211	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn't have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn't bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn't see anything in sight.	3	3	3
7212	3	"The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story "Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit". The cyclist's expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. ".I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasn't many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. "One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me" (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills "(@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn't enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negativly affected the cyclist expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey"	3	2	3
7213	3	I belive the setting of an area can affect the mind when put is certin situations. In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood.	1	1	1
7214	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don't know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 	2	2	2
7215	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a "shortcut" that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park." He thought he knew where he was going "I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, "this sight was troubling". I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, "she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was "only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. " The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, "Gary and wilbers fish camp". He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys."	2	2	2
7216	3	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, "I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." @CAPS1 feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…" @CAPS1 example is, "I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways.	2	2	2
7217	3	In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit", there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park.	3	3	3
7218	3	"The features of the setting made the cyclist's journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a @CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey."	3	3	3
7219	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2	2
7220	3	he wouldn't know he would be faceing while rider or the road @MONTH1 be something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike's wheels or he might fall of his the bick he would set so tired that he can't go any more he might give it up	1	1	1
7221	3	The setting sffects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people that most be the best mood nice and colun no cars and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with, like if there is infrastructure he must have to watch for people, cars and just have to day to streetsigns and act. So thats outing  the feature of the setting would affect the cyclsit.	1	1	1
7222	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3	2	3
7223	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. There were	1	1	1
7224	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn't get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.'' You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them.	3	2	3
7225	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route, that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadn't left off their porches for decades.  also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite & he had gotten some advice from ???(not legible onwards)	1	1	1
7226	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved,    	2	2	2
7227	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclist's job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.	1	1	1
7228	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2	2
7229	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. "Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn't because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. "It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean." Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn't been running out of water I don't think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse.	3	2	3
7230	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehidrate. Also looking for water slowed him dsown more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1	1
7231	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct." This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead," by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage." This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, "To @CAPS2 a fire" where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "	3	3	3
7232	3	The feature of a setting can affect a cyclist energy. In the setting turns irds hills, it can every this Cyclist out.	1	1	1
7233	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most on the fact that it strained him out the hydrated state. It made him unable to operate at his full power/efficiency. It deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1	1
7234	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says "and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June." This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.	1	1	1
7235	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says "the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips" and then it goes on to say, "I could drop from from a heat stroke." This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat.	2	1	2
7236	3	Features of the setling affected the cyclist were the harsh & hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how "the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration.	1	1	1
7237	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you'd have to be prepared just in case they don't find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm.	1	1	1
7238	3	"The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, "Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." It also says, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist."	1	1	1
7239	3	"The cyclist's condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" And, ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time."	1	2	2
7240	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, "Do Not Exceed Posted Limit", were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot @DATE1. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to past by deserted towns, "This place might have been thriving little spot...a ghost town." The terrain was threatening because after twenty two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, "short rolling hills", which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the trechorous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcome.	1	1	1
7241	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood.	2	2	2
7242	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke." This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn't get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, "the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to.	2	2	2
7243	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this "journey" to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. "A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling." This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says "working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength." @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist."	2	2	2
7244	3	"In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. "I was traveling the hish deserts of California in June" This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. "This place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to ware. She had a shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story.   "	3	2	3
7245	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn't have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit." the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don't listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn't be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.	1	2	2
7246	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist since it is affecting her condition. She needs water to survive, and the next town is very far away. So she could possibly pass out without brake, and the hot temperatures. "When I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acid" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). If she doesn't find water soon, it will affect herb condition. Also, the features of the setting affects her determination. When she knows that she needs to find a town. she works harder. ""i would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so atleast or my inner spirit""(@NUM1). She would try her hardest to make smart moves, and make it to a town, as fast as possible. She works harder since she knows without water, her life is in danger. Now, things could get even rougher."	3	2	3
7247	3	"During the cyclist journey in "Rough Road Ahead" by joe Kurmaskie he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When hes wrideing he says the road is flat. "Flat road was replaced"" This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat. Then as hes rideing he notice the land change." Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills." this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed. That's how the land changes  "	1	1	1
7248	3	The features affect the cyclist.The setting affects the cyclist because it's real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips weren't really short cuts. So now he's riding and angry that he took their tips. Also he's running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about @NUM1 to cool the water, but it doesn't cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that he's about to die and regrets listening to men who haven't got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it's a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says he's never listening to old men and he'll always use the map.	3	2	3
7249	3	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump & old shed. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all. When the cyclist continues, tumble weeds that look like "diamond head snakes" cross her path. She encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building, It is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journy but decides not to take his advice because of the path the last set of elderly men set her down. 	2	2	2
7250	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay "Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit" the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  	2	2	2
7251	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, they ware heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said they taste "like battery acid." And he had to convince up the road for anothe @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself	1	1	1
7253	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.	1	1	1

7256	3	In the essay, "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, "traveling through the high deserts of California in June." Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, "Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills." This setting is a major setback to the cyclist's journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.	3	3	3

7259	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is so negative. Everything around the cyclist is percieved negatively, so the naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he can't go on and is weak because there is no living he around him. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier.	1	1	1
7260	3	The fatures of the setting affected the cyclist by it hard for him to control hill bike down on rough road, hotter making him thisty and running out of water. Also there wasnt an building in sight so he could get anything to drink. Also he did know where he was go. These are the features that affected the cyclist	2	2	2

7263	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the "high deserts of California in June." With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying "I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"" shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated "I had an overwhelming and buy some bait" showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water."	2	2	2
7264	3	"In the story "Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1	1
7265	3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. "The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it." The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. "…telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine." @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. "…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope." @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope.

At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.	2	3	3
7266	3	In the essay, "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an "Ghost town" with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2	2	2
7267	3	Well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others. Also the author faced alot of problems like the lack of water, the poisonous snakes and the condition of the road. So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.	2	2	2
7268	3	In the passage "Do not exceed posted speed limit," there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says "At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake", "I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state" This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that.	1	1	1
7269	3	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn't in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, "There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind." There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips." @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.	2	2	2
7270	3	The feature of the setting do affect cyclist in such ways making him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He saw all idea that a juice factory was working, when it was abounded. He saw rusty pipes, this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water.	1	1	1
7271	3	In the short story "Do not exceed posted speed limit" the settings of the story affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried. In the story the cyclist takes two old men's advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. "I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean." That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn't have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.	3	2	3
7272	3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, "over one long crippling hill, a building came into view" This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke." This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn't helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don't make a life-threating choice.	3	2	3
7273	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pump's water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story.	1	2	2
7274	3	I am going to write a response that explains how the features of the setting affects the cyclist. In my response, I will include examples from the essay that support my conclusion. I think the features in the setting affect the cyclist because different things such as snow or rocks could affect the way someone rides.	0	0	0
7275	3	In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along  his ride he meets some old but confident men. They tell him a new rout wich "was to slice away hours" from his ride the setting was excedingly hot @DATE1. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way the first was a "baren ghost town" the next had water "the flavor of battery acid, then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a baite shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns & don't let old timers try and change your mind.	3	2	3
7276	3	In the essay "Rough Road ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many changes due to the setting of what was around. The cyclist was lost in the dessert. This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldn't have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water. Without the water, he could become very weak and dehydrated.  and could have even died. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly.	2	2	2
7277	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw "Gary and Wilber's fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet!" The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no.	2	2	2
7278	3	"In the short story "Do not exeed the speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was "One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic" he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers's fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."	2	2	2
7279	3	One of the main things that affect the cyclists is the heat. Due to the heat he drinks all of his water. Another feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the rough road since he is so tired he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions.	1	1	1
7280	3	In the story," Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit," written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, "Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills "@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure" tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me." The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3	3	3
