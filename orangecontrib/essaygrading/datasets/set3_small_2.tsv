6061	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, 'Rough Road Ahead' which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3	3																					
6062	3	 The bike rider in the short story 'Do not exceed posted speed limit' by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can’t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldn’t have has either problems.	1	1	1																					
6063	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch’s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2	2																					
6064	3	In the passage,the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water.Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains.Where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place.Both of these features had a great a tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles.	2	2	2																					
6065	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, 'Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.' This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, 'tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.' This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, 'no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.'	2	2	2																					
6066	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could affect how the cyclist is riding . If it’s to hot the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster . And if it’s to cold then the cyclist would @MONTH1 be get sick . Also if it‘s  too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going in the wind’s direction.	1	1	1																					
6067	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.   	1	1	1																					
6068	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says 'Rough Road Ahead…(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water.	2	1	2																					
6069	3	The features of the setting affect the the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills, he would have to slow down so he could manuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke.	1	2	2																					
6070	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.	2	2	2																					
6071	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist’s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in 'the high deserts of California in June,' the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2	2																					
6072	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. 'The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.' There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. 'Not two miles into the next section.' He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. 'I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.' It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2	2																					
6073	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination.	2	1	2																					
6074	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He’s in California in June, and it’s very hot. It’s pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist.	2	2	2																					
6075	3	In the essay 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,' the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the 'resevoir compground' he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving 'the serenity of an early-summer evening and he’s headed toward 'The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.' He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the 'ghost town' and the 'sun was beginning to beat down' he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he’s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once 'a thriving little spot.' Next, when the cyclist comes to 'one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral' he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a 'tarlike substance' so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the 'rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake' it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom' and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. 	3	3	3																					
6076	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody’s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he’s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody’s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let’s say that he gets lost and he’ll need direction to get wherever he’s going well there’s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. 	1	2	2																					
6077	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1	1																					
6078	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2	2																					
6079	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, 'There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.' This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory' This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, 'GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP' The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3	3																					
6080	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the 'Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.' The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it 'Over on long, crippling hill'. The word 'crippling' is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding.	1	2	2																					
6081	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2	2																					
6082	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn’t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,	1	1	1																					
6083	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.	1	1	1																					
6084	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, 'several rusty bumps,' is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn’t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. 'Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2	3																					
6085	3	The setting in 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, ' and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ' The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. 'A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.' @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. 	3	3	3																					
6086	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says 'there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1	1																					
6087	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2	2																					
6088	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, 'The sun was beginning to beat down'(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. 'Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. 'I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2	2																					
6089	3	In the eassy 'DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,' It is a clear cut for survival as it seems that this man is fighting to stay alive. As l know cyclists pedal for hours at a time and sometimes for hundreds of miles of he was biking where green grass and cool mountains collide the tone and mood of the essay would of beam completely different.He uses sentences such as '… of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.' @CAPS1 all make me want to read further in the essay to see lf he will be ok by thes end of his journey? I know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated. I couldn’t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumble weed. It sounds like an awful experience. If he were somewhere cooler and colorful his experience wouldnt of been so horrific.	3	3	3																					
6090	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	1	1																					
6091	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting."	2	3	3																					
6092	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am I’m surprised he lived and that he was that lucky.	1	1	1																					
6093	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men adviced him cyclist had high hopes as a looked and senery enjoyed seeing very ? of the struggle.	1	1	1																					
6094	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him.	1	1	1																					
6095	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,' greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities. 'I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was 'traveling through the high deserts of California in June' without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. 'At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.' He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3	3	3																					
6096	3	"The features of the setting in 'Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, 'affect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, '…A young   pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head '   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels de pressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self esteem and think about diying."	2	2	2																					
6097	3	The cyclist went on a rough journey and he was explaning how tiering it was and difficult it was for him going from town to town having to diel with lack of water poisonous snakes and the condition of the road.	1	1	1																					
6098	3	The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, 'a ghost town.' @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is 'traveling through the deserts of California in June.' Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2	3																					
6099	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resene when it @CAPS1 the signs  that said 'Rough @CAPS2 ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.' That had to slow down his bike. 'Then he said that their were no building or cars nowhere	1	1	1																					
6100	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, 'This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.' This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, 'One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn’t had in the larger mule greeted me.' This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned 'old timers' who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.         	1	2	2																					
6101	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the fisrt 'toun'. The setting of the desert affected the cyclilst because the cyclist, because cyclist was arising doun the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of driead sweat circled my shirt, and ?? he ?? that should drop from heatsroke on a gorqeas day in june simply because I listened to some gentleman who were it been off their ??? ???, ??? to tough. This my responese to the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2	2																					
6102	3	The cyclist trusted a man that didn`t know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasen’t anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the '@CAPS1 Juice' company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no.	2	2	2																					
6103	3	"During the passage 'Do not exceed speed limit', the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in 'The high deserts of California in June'. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says 'over one long, crippling hill,' This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that 'There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way."	2	2	2																					
6104	3	It affects the cyclist because in the begging talk’s ablut the old man. Italso talks about basically saying there information is out of aase also in other words should have just followed his map in the first place.	1	1	1																					
6105	3	"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3	3	3																					
6106	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot. The narration states, 'Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt' (@NUM1). This caused him to drink water until he ran out. The narration states, 'The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips' (@NUM1). He then had to suck on pebbles which he could have choked on. The narration states, 'With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat'(@NUM1).	1	1	1																					
6107	3	In the story 'Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit' there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. ' I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read 'Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn’t think they knew what they were talking about. Due to the fact they never left their porches. As you can see the setting most deffinated effected the cyclist in physical or mental ways.	2	2	2																					
6108	3	"The features of the setting affects he cyclist. One way it affect the cyclist is it by being hotlike a says in the text""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgerous day in June ""@CAPS1 way it affects the cyclist by being bumby like it says in the text ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" that is how the setting affects the cyclist."	1	1	1																					
6109	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. For example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die ' I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean' then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says 'I own a very good map' But as he journeys to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. Then probably on his merry way to his destination.	2	2	2																					
6110	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit’ by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn’t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn’t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal.	1	2	2																					
6111	3	The features of the setting affects the cycles such that it was affecting his altermmation to continue. For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the 'ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral… This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of 'battery acid.' It also goes on to say that it was a 'test for my inner spirit.' It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on.	2	2	2																					
6112	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was 'long and a               ' The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the tempeture was	1	1	1																					
6113	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn’t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won’t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3	3	3																					
6114	3	The different settings that the cyclist had to ??? were mountains or hills winding roads and California desert in June. As well as he was running out of water.	1	1	1																					
6115	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.	1	2	2																					
6116	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of 'california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, ‘The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.' @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, 'I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…' When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2	2																					
6117	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti’s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what’s going to happen next.	1	1	1																					
6118	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist .At first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy .He had plat smooth roads to go through .He started out before the sun could to him.' The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite my name written all it 'He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him .Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder .I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills 'So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster.' At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state '.By the tumble weeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time .So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated .This was a hard task for him to overcome .By the terrain changing it become harder for him.	3	2	3																					
6119	3	The setting in this short story 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' is a hot, sunny desert, in which all towns have been abandoned, 'The sun was beginning to beat down' (@NUM1) ' i arrived at the first town it fit the defination of a ghost town (@NUM1) trational. The cyclist at this point is not, tired and worried about the lack of water. The setting and cyclist’s state run side by side.	1	1	1																					
6120	3	In the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamond back snackes. Also the whole race, the cyclist biggest problem was water. He ran out quickly. And when he saw the factory and stopped. He put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water, and lets yours split circulate. The cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination.	2	2	2																					
6121	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch’s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2	3																					
6122	3	During the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions. Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, 'The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,' as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and 'slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.' When he saw Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he realized he was safe.	2	2	2																					
6123	3	The byciclist from 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit' was effected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The byciclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hotwhere the narrator was bycicling. When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it. All of these things affected him. 	2	0	3																					
6124	3	'Do not exceed posted speed limit' by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of 'a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,' this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3	3																					
6125	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one, the conditions of the road were awful. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired. Those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist.	2	2	2																					
6126	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or vermont, it would be a no-brairer to bike in vermont. The temperature in vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story the cyclist comlains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. "	1	1	1																					
6127	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get   the first 'town', he didn’t seem to mind. 'The cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,' is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. Meaning that he   didn’t mind or wasn’t   troubled   by it  at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of 'troubling sights', because they were abandoned and no one   was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP,  his   emotions, and mind changed from begin lugubvious, to becoming thankful.	3	3	3																					
6128	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, 'the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.' @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a 'ridiculously large snake' and 'trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and 'in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.' @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.	3	2	3																					
6129	3	The features of the setting were very affective in the story '@CAPS1’t exceed @CAPS2 Speed Limit.' It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to roling hills. That’s going to be hard to pedal a bike on. Another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If the gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and thugs like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist.	2	2	2																					
6130	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he relizes its hopeless. He was laughting when people told him the right directions and now 'It was sad, hopeless laught, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self.' said the cyclist when he was refering back to the first town. The reason this affect the cyclist is at first he was going good then he got thirsty and bad things happened.  thats how it affect th cyclist.	1	1	1																					
6131	3	In the story 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,' written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills. The speed limit affected the author because he felt that he was moving to slow. In the story when it says 'I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1,' is evidence of this	1	1	1																					
6132	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3	3																					
6133	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn’t have much water to drink.	1	1	1																					
6134	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. 'I arrived at the first 'town'. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.' He is saying that the town could’ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. 'I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t cool down.' A working water pump would’ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading	2	2	2																					
6135	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is 'flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.' That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be 'high deserts of California in June.' That’s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the 'summer time' its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	1	2	2																					
6136	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1	1																					
6137	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink.	2	2	2																					
6138	3	In 'Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting. She was first effected by the old men which told her a 'shortcut' to her ride to Yosemite National Park. Then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon 'Gary and Wilber’s fish camp' where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except 'Gary and Wilber’s fish camp' which saved her from dehydration.	2	2	2																					
6139	3	In the short story, 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. @CAPS1 thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, 'The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.' @CAPS1 setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles.	2	2	2																					
6140	3	The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.	1	1	1																					
6141	3	In the essay 'Rough Road Ahead' the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2	2																					
6142	3	Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a 'ghost town' there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.	2	2	2																					
6143	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says ' The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.' A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don’t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh'. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2	3																					
6144	3	The cyclist knowing not where he was going got a wrong enformation and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knows where he’s heading too. Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through. The features affects him because he doesn’t know where he was going and he wait a as her cut.' Then he was going to wrong direction and he wasn’t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was' summer time' it was hot and he was riding a bicycle not a car.	3	2	3																					
6145	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, 'I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.' This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he’ll have later on. As he passes a snake, 'trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.' So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, '…I could drop from heatstroke…' meaning he’s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he’s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he’s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, 'I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…' By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3	3																					
6146	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, 'There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind' (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills' (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, 'I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June' (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."	2	2	2																					
6147	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, 'wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.' It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down	2	1	2																					
6148	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. 	1	2	2																					
6149	3	The features of the settings in 'Do not exceed the posted speed limit' by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says 'There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.' He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay 'rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent.	2	2	2																					
6150	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could’ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.	2	2	2																					
6151	3	In the essay 'Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and it’s a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start 'The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…'(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages.	2	2	2																					
6152	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...' This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2	2																					
6153	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight and he  had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he  was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live.	1	2	2
