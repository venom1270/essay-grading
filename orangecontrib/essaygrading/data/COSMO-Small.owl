   last edit 20080319 by Patrick Cassidy cassidy@micra.com
   Purpose: COSMO is intended to be an internally logically consistent
     foundation ontology that includes representations of all concepts
     used in the 'base defining vocabulary' of English words (approximately
     2000 base words, up to 10,000 with morphological variants).
     The goal is to provide an inventory of basic concepts that can
     be used in combination to create representations of any concept in
     any specialized domain.  This goal is likely to be approached incrementally,
     and the foundation ontology is always open to inclusion of new
     primitives whose meaning cannot be specified by existing elements in
     the COSMO.  Such an ontology can serve as the basis for semantic interoperability,
     allowing separated groups to define their own domains in terms of the 
     foundation ontology, and communicate when desired by sharing definitions not already in 
     the COSMO.
     
   NOTE: the 'version' number includes the revision number, which increases
     independently of the version number.  A new major version number indicates
     some significant change, either in fundamental concept representations,
     or in number of elements added.  Revision numbers increase each time
     enough changes have been made to warrant a new consistency check.
     
   revision 597
   At revision 589 and after (2008-02-22), the stable site for maintaining versions of
       the COSMO ontology will be http://micra.com/COSMO
   At revision 597 the relation 'hasAttribute' was changed to 'hasAttributeValue' due
       to addition of the Attribute Type.
   
   Version 0.47-577 loaded to CIM3 site 20080208

    ran version 0.47-605 through OWL validator, using Pellet called from
       Protege 3.3.1.  No inconsistencies reported, though
       a number of superfluous parent types were detected,
       and some implied instances were absent.
    ca. 3670 OWL Classes, > 191 of which are synonyms
    ca. 400 relations including datatype
 version number change to 0.47 at revision 589 -  small changes in 'Organization'
    and 'Event'
 
  NOTE: most concept representations were taken from the OpenCyc version 0.78,
  and many from the SUMO + MILO versions made available to the IEEE..
  The MILO components were made available under the GNU GPL.
  The comments provided by Cyc (used as a short form of OpenCyc) will usually
  mention constants (terms) that are prefixed by a pound-dollar sign,
  like '#$Quantity', and can be  recognized by that formalism, but
  may not be otherwise labeled as coming from the OpenCyc ontology.  Also,
  any Type that has a <guid> </guid> element will also have come from Cyc.
  SUMO comments are usually prefixed by a 'SUMO:' header.
  Other comments may be prefixed by a 'COSMO note' or without any distinctive 
  source markings, and these may be assumed to be added specifically for 
  the COSMO ontology.
  
  Within the comments, reference to Types or Relations defined in this 
  ontology will often be marked by the use of single quotes, as in 'guid'.
  However, this is not always followed, particularly in cases where the
  Types mentioned have names evocative of ordinary words, like 'Object'
  or 'Person'.  In such cases the quotes may be left off, and the intended
  sense will be that the discussion applies to the real-world entities 
  as well as the formal representation of those entities.
  
  History: Started with the initial COSMO ontology.
     Preliminary merge of basic elements of Cyc and SUMO completed
     20070321.  Started adding in Types from BFO 20070322. Most BFO
     elements added (with modifications) 20070329.
     At each point, some Types and relations that were not in any of the starting
     ontologies, or were present in a different form, were also added.

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >The class of Synonyms has two uses:
    (1) When a synonymous term is included as a subtype of Synonym, 
      it allows searching for a Type by more than one term, in the case where
      the alternative term(s) are also unique in the ontology.  For
      example, where Cyc class names (but not meanings) have been changed,
      the Cyc term may also be included as a Synonym.  We use
      the isaSynonymOf relation to relate Synonym
      classes to the class with the base name.
     (2) when used with the 'hasSynonym' relation, instances
       of Synonym can specify the context (such as namespace)
       in which the second term is a synonym of the first, and
       can indicate the overall frequency with which the term in that
       context actually has the same meaning as the base term.
       Since there can be multiple instances of the same synonymous
       term, it is represented as a datatype String entity.
       
       NOTE that instances of Synonym need to have unique id's as
       their identifiers in the ontology, so it is recommended 
       that the unique ID's be generated by prefixing a namespace
       to the synonymous term that is pointed to by the 
       'hasSynonymousTerm' property of the Synonym instance.
       
       Thus if some term has the synonym 'process' in the PSL context,
        the instance of Synonym that specifies that relation can be named,
        e.g. 'PSL$process'.

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Object">
    <rdfs:comment>Objects can be Physical or Abstract or Mental. 
    All Objects have at least one relation to some other entity.
    The relation may be to have an AttributeType and associated AttributeValue.
    But it may be some other relation (e.g. to have a location, or to
    have proper parts).  Thus a point can have Dimensionality (zero-dimensional),
    and will have a location, though the location may be in a
    poorly defined abstract space.  A character in an  alphabet is
    an abstract object, which has at least one representation as a 
    shaped physical object.  This requirement form an Object to have some relation
    is not formalized in COSMO, as it is not needed for performance,
    only to clarify the meaning for the human users.
       'Object' is a very primitive concept that cannot be defined, but can be 
    comprehended only by the way this concept interacts with other concepts, 
    and by its subclasses and instances.  This Type is useful as an
    umbrella Type for various purposes,including relations on Events.</rdfs:comment>

      A Sign may be Physical or Abstract or Mental.  'Sign' is a very general
      concept, and is used primarily through its specialized subtypes.
      A physical phenomenon (smoke) can be a sign (of a smoke-producing process),

    >The most general Type for Objects whose subtypes are abstract - intangible -
    things that do not have mass.   Note that AbstractEntity is not a subtype 
    of AbstractObject - the name 
    'Abstract' is retained for alignment with other ontologies.  NOTE in 
    particular that AbstractEntity is not disjoint from
    MentalObject, which may be created by people in space and time, and
    hae a location in space and time.  The kind of abstract things that do not
    have a locaiton in space and time are under 'AbstrctObject' in COSMO.

     COSMO Note:  the notion of 'Abstract' has historically been somewhat vague.
     It is often defined by saying that it represents things 'not located in
     space or time' - but then subclasses are defined which are clearly 
     mental constructs with a defined creation time (e.g. musical compositions) -
     which means that they must indeed be located in time and space. 
     In this ontology we distinguish 'Abstract' things from 'MentalObjects' -
     the latter are things created by IntelligentAgents (people) that have
     no mass, and therefore would traditionally be categorized as 'Abstract'.
     'AbstractObject' here is used mostly to categorize mathematical things 
     such as numbers, which arguably do not depend on intelligent entities for 
     their existence. But 'AbstractEntities" and 'MentalObjects' are not considered 
     disjoint here, so there is room for people to argue whether mathematical
     concepts are created or merely discovered by mathematicians - we take no

    The current (20061027) arrangement here is provisional, keeping some of the
    terminology from Cyc and SUMO for alignment - but it may be changed slightly 
    in the future in a way that will not affect inferencing.

    Intangible_Cyc__Abstract_SUMO__abstract_object_ISO15926

   ISO15926 An Abstract-object is a thing that does not exist in space-time.
   (COSMO note - this is not the interpretation in COSMO - MentalObjects
   are abstract, but they do 'exist' in our ordinary space and time.)

   SUMO: Abstract : Properties or qualities as distinguished from any particular embodiment
   of the properties/qualities in a physical medium. Instances of Abstract can be said
   to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects such as sets and relations, 
   but they cannot exist at a particular place and time without some
   physical encoding or embodiment.

   #$Intangible:  OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
   The collection of things that are not physical - are not made of, or encoded in, matter. 
   Every #$Collection is an #$Intangible (even if its instances are tangible), and so 
   are some #$Individuals. Caution: do not confuse 'tangibility' with 'perceivability'
   - humans can perceive light even though it's intangible--at least in a sense.

   <owl:Class rdf:ID="Context">
    <rdfs:comment>COSMO: Context is a very general class of entities that
      can affect the truth of a logical sentence; within any
      given Context, the factual assertions should all be
      logically consistent.  A Context may be relevant to the internal
      states and processes of a computational system, or may more generally
      describe the broad situation in which an Agent finds itself when 
      processing information for the purpose of making a decision.  For the
      latter agent context, the subtype 'SituationalContextComponent' is 
      relevant.  A Context can be a time interval, location, belief system,
      fictional world, theory, hypothetical world, counterfactual situation, 
      segment of text, DatabaseGroup, or the state of our own real world, among other things.
      Contexts can be nested, combined, or intersected.  For example, 
      a Context consisting of a TimeInterval can be intersected with a Context
      consisting of a GeographicalArea to make a Context within with assertions
      are explicitly true only in that time and place.  That does not
      mean, of course that the assertion cannot be true elsewhere; 
      it just doesn't guranteee truth elsewhere.  Every assertion in
      the COSMO ontology is implicitly true only in the 
      context of the COSMO ontology, which is itself a theory.  But that 
      implicit qualification does not appear directly in any asertion - 
      it can be explicitly mentioned if and when COSMO assertions are 
      referenced in other ontologies.
      
      The nesting of Contexts provides a mechanism to create a 
      'lattice' of theories.  In a subcontext for any given
      Context, all the assertions of the parent Context will be
      true in the subcontext, and additional assertions may also be true.
      In this respect, a Context is similar to the 'Microtheories' of
      the Cyc ontology system; it also has some resemblance to
      the 'Environments' discussed by Ballim and Wilks ('Artifical Believers',
      Lawrence Erlbaum, 1991).
      
      One specialized example of Context is a 'DatabaseGroup'.  In a
      particular Organization, its set of Databases, if intended to 
      represent some consistent group of facts, can be viewed and 
      represented as a Context within which reasoning may be performed.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="holdsInContext">
     <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Proposition"/>
    <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Context"/>
    <rdfs:comment>holdsInContext relates a reified Proposition to a Context in which
     it is asserted to be true.  The Context may be as simple as a
     TimeInteral or a Database, or it may be a complex context which
     is a conjunction of a time interval, a location, a belief system, and
     any other thing tha might affect the truth of an assertion.  Context
     in COSMO is used solely as a syntactic device to provide
     an umbrella category that can serve as the argument restriction
     on the 'holdsInContext' statement.  There is no general 'theory'
     of context implied in this usage.  Other than its syntactical
     usage, the only thing that can be asserted about 'contexts' generally
     is that the principle of non-contradiction holds only in a single
     context, and for assertions defined in different contexts, it cannot
     be expected that they will be necessarily true in any other context.
     
     Any set of assertions (including this ontology) will have an
     implied enveloping context.  If the assertions are to be reused,
     it is necessary to be sure that the context of reuse is the same as that
     of the original set of assertions.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>GenericLocation is the Type representing the most
      general notion of location, which can be abstract or concrete,
      a region of space (including an abstract space, such as the 
      Internet considered as a set of nodes and links, where the nodes
      can represent computers whose physical location may vary),
      a point in space, or a physical object (e.g. building, ship, room).

     NOTE that an Address is not a location, but a label for a location.
        See 'Address'.

     NOTE: although *almost* all GenericLocations are exclusively spatial
      in some way, there is one 'TimeAndPlace' that is spatiotemporal,
      being a region of space-time that specifies some region of space
      over some interval of time.  Use of an instance of 'TimeAndPlace'
      as an argument of a location relation allows one to include the
      important time interval qualifier in location relations, even though
      one is using only binary relations.  this would not be necessary
      in a representation with higher-arity relations.
       
     This is somewhat similar to the Cyc 'Location-Underspecified'
     Cyc comment:   The collection of locations, tangible or
         otherwise, which are typically conceptualized by human
         beings for purposes of common-sense reasoning as 'locations'.
         This collection thus includes tangible Places such as
         #$Ireland-TheIsland, as well as metaphoric locations. For
         instance, many states-of-being are conceptualized as
         abstract locations, such as Trouble ('he saw trouble
         ahead'), Depression ('she fell into a ...'),
         #$Happiness ('they found bliss together').</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This is the most generic generic 'location' relation, 
      and differs from its subProperty 'isLocatedAt' only in that 
      to be 'located at or on' includes the possibility that
      some pile of objects may be located in some open container and 
      extend beyond the top of the container, but will move when that
      container moves because it is held to the container by the
      force of gravity or by some topological constraint.  The 
      subproperty 'isLocatedAt' means that the thing located is
      wholly locaed within the spatial region coextensie with the
      convex hull of the thing or place where it is located.
      Thus a pile of coal in an open railway coal car can be said to be
      'contained' in the coal car even though it may extend above the
      top of the coal car; it will go wherever the coal car goes,
      as long as it satisfies this relation.  Likewise, flowers in a 
      vase are located 'at or on' the vase, though they typically extend 
      beyond the top of the vase, and the top of the flowers may
      even be above the vase by more than the height of the vase.

      The 'isContainedIn'  relation is a subproperty of this relation; therefore
      if {?x isContainedIn ?Obj} then {?x isLocatedAtOrOn ?Obj}.
      
      NOTE, however that 'isSupportedBy' is not a subtype of 'isLocatedAtOrOn'
      because the supporting object may be flat and extensive, and the supported
      object may extend well above the surface of the supporting object..</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="#isLocatedAtOrOn"/>
    <rdfs:comment>A general 'location' relation for objects and
      regions (but not for Events - use 'occurredAt').
      The location can be a region of space (connected or disconnected)
      or an object (physical or abstract).  Being 'located' at an
      Object means being located within the convex hull of the Object,
      But recall that a GeographicalRegion includes some space above
      the surface of that region, so it is possible that ?obj isLocateAt
      a GeographicalRegion even if it is in the air not far above the 
      surface of that region.
      If a pile of objects or a large object is 'contained' in an
      open-top container, and extends above the top of that container,
      it cannot be said to be 'located at' thet container, in this sense.
      For that case, use 'isContainedIn' or its parent 'isLocatedAtOrOn'.
      The value (object) of this relation answers the question 
      'where is it?' (for the subject) in some sense.  Somewhat 
      non-intuitively, this relation can be used to specify that some set of 
      beliefs (a BeliefSystem) is held by on or more people,
      since the BeliefSystem is considered an InformationStore that
      can have a physical location; that is, beliefs are located in the
      heads of people, or of Groups of people. However, NOTE that 
      specific diseases cannot be located in people by this
      relation, because a Disease is considered as an Event.  Use
      'occurredAt' for relating specific instances of Disease to
      particular people or groups of people.
      
      NOTE that this is an instance-level relation and describes
      where an object is actually located at some particular time.
      For describing where objects typically are located (e.g.
      parts of the body), use 'isNormallyLocatedAt', a relation
      that can take a individual Object or an ObjectType as the
      subject
      
      NOTE: 'isLocatedAt' may be used with an instance
       of 'TimeAndPlace' (a four-dimensional portion of aspace-time)
       in the object position of the relation, to specify the
       location of some thing (but not Events) over some
       interval of time, using a binary relation.  Although this relation
       is transitive, there are permitted range instances that cannot
       bw located at some permitted domain instances: for example, a
       'TimeAndPlace' will never be locatedAt an Object or region that
       is not itself Four-dimensional, unless the domain instance is nominally
       a TimeAndPlace, but with the Time dimension of zero length, in which case
       the domain instance is effectively three-dimensional.  But in general, 
       if the subject is a TimeAndPlace, the Object should also be a TimeAndPlace,
       not a Region or Object.  To avoid unintended errors, this restriction
       should be encoded as a constraint.
       
      NOTE: this relation is close in meaning to that of the OBO_REL relation
      'located_in' (http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/#OBO_REL:located_in).  In OBO
      some relations may also be used on Types to create an implicit restriction,
      but such usage is not part of COSMO, and that usage would need to be 
      represented as a rule.
    OBO_REL: located_in (see http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/)
    OBO comments for located_in: Location as a relation between instances: 
       The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact
       that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial 
       region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define 
       a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the 
       region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and 
       another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region 
       occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1. Note that 
       this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one 
       continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical 
       (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as 
       those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, 
       between brain and head or between ovum and uterus

        This can also be used for types of Events, to specify

    <rdfs:comment>A TimeAndPlace is a GenericLocation during some interval

    that a time-slice of a PhysicalObject is a four-dimensional
    Object.  These concepts are related inheriting the character of
    the TimeSlice Type.
    
      this is a SpatiotemporalRegion that has an explicit location and an explicit 
      time interval specified.  The location is generic, therefore it can
      be defined relative to some object; i.e. one can specify the 
      location of the heart of an individual person over some period
      of time as an instance of this Type.
      
     NOTE: That 'TimeAndPlace' is a subtype of GenericLocation,
      as well as of SpatiotemporalRegion.  Although *almost* all
      GenericLocations are exclusively spatial,
      'TimeAndPlace' is spatiotemporal, being a region of space-time 
      that specifies some region of space over some interval of time.
      Use of an instance of 'TimeAndPlace' as an argument
      of a location relation allows one to include the
      important time interval qualifier in location relations, even though
      one is using only binary relations.  this would not be necessary

  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="correspondsToEntityInContext">
    <rdfs:comment>points from one entity in the COSMO ontology
    to another entity in some named Context within which 
    the entity in the Context has a direct equivalance to the ontology entity
    is the subject of the triple.  This permits the ad hoc
    definition of a Context within which reasoning can occur.
    
    This relation is inherently ternary, and should be elaborated
    when Ternary relations are represented.  See also the
    relations on Databases - such as 'correspondsToTable'
    
    Together with the relation 'isDefinedInContext' it is
    possible to create ad hoc (or map) a set of terms that are synonymous
    with entities in the COSMO (or an extension) and perform
    reasoning only on terms within that Context.  This contemplates
    at least two scenarios:
    (1) some previous conceptual classification is imported, and
       because of name clashes, is given its own namespace, which
       is defined as a Context.  For those names that clash, 
       the entity in the imported Context is given a namespace
       prefix to keep it unique within the overall ontology.
       The reasoning engine should then reason only within
       a given Context.
    (2) To make a subset of the overall ontology for efficiency
        purposes, a Context can be defined and each entity in the
        overall ontology that is needed in the new dcontext will be
        related to that Context by this relation 
        ('correspondsToEntityInContext').  The reasoning engine will then
        be able to recognize a Context within which reasoning and inference
        can be confined.</rdfs:comment>

      To be 'near' another region or object, the distance from one Object or
      Region to the other must be within two diameters of the larger object or region.
      NOTE that 'isSupportedBy' is a subproperty of 'isNearTo'.
    
      If two objects are touching, that can be represented as a 'TouchingState'.

  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="isAdjacentTo">
    <rdfs:comment>isAdjacentTo specifies that some GenericLocation (an
      Object or a Region) is 'adjacent' to another.  This means that it might
      be touching, with nothing in between, or might be separated by
      some thin space, which might have a name, as in a 'crack' or a
      sulcus in the brain. If there is a solid object separating them, two
      GenericLocations can be 'near' but not 'adjacent'.
      NOTE that this relation makes intuitive sense only when the 
      adjacent objects are of comparable size.  We do not usually 
      say that a bacterium on the skin is 'adjacent to' the skin.
      A different (perhaps more general) relation should be defined for
      such cases, because the gap that exists in non-touching cases
      can be large relative to one object and small relative to the other.
      
      NOTE: this is similar to the instance-level OBO_REL relation 'adjacent_to',
      except that this COSMO relation is solely an instance relation and
      is not used at the Type level.  For specifying the typical
      relations of Types (as in the OBO definition below), a 
      separate class-level relation and inference axioms will be required.
      
      OBO_REL: relation adjacent_to: (only the instance-level relation
         is similar to COSMO 'isAdjacentTo'.
      Definition: C adjacent to C' if and only if: given any
      instance c that instantiates C at a time t, there is some c' 
      such that: c' instantiates C' at time t and c and c' are in 
      spatial proximity.
      OBO Comments: Note that adjacent_to as thus defined is not 
      a symmetric relation, in contrast to its instance-level counterpart.
      For it can be the case that Cs are in general such as to be adjacent
      to instances of C1 while no analogous statement holds for C1s in general
      in relation to instances of C. Examples are: 
      nuclear membrane adjacent_to cytoplasm; 
      seminal vesicle adjacent_to urinary bladder;

    <rdfs:comment>Each Attribute is an entity that has an AttributeType
        and some form of AttributeValue; it can serve as the value of a
       'hasAttribute' relation.  There are three subtypes of Attribute:
       QuantitativeAttribute, QualitativeAttribute, and IntensiveAttribute.
       
       In COSMO, the representation of 'attributes' (properties in informal
          terms) includes two or three aspects:
        (1) the AttributeType (Color, Length, Flexibility).  The AttributeType
          specifies the kind of attribute that is being represented
        (2) the AttributeValue (Color -Red; Length - 10 feet; Flexibility - high)
            for quantitative attributes (10 feet, 30 pounds) the AttributeValue
            is composed of both a number and a UnitOfMeasure.  The UnitOfMeasure
            includes 'Dimensionless', a pure number (e.g. as an attribute of
            'Cardinality' for a Group)
       
       In the case of quantitative attributes, rather than pointing
       from an instance of Attribute to a QuantitativeAttributeValue,
       the relations 'hasUnit' and 'hasQuantifier'can poont directly
       to the UnitOfMeasure and the Quantifier
       the AttributeValue is 
       represented as the UnitOfMeasure and the quantifier, separately.
       
       For QualitativeAttributes the AttributeValue may be 
       directly represented.  For IntensiveAttributes, the AttributeValue
       can have interal-type intensity values such as 'Low', 'Medium',
       'High'.  The type of an Attribute is specified as the value of
       the 'hasType' relation.</rdfs:comment>

    >hasQualitativeAttribute relates individual Objects or substances
    to some qualitative attribute (a subclass of QualitativeAttributeValue)
    that the object has.
    
    The accurate use of this property for substances is difficult to express
    in OWL.  Since Substances are classes, to describe a qualitative
    attribute of a substance, in OWL one would need a metatype specifically for
    each substance, which multiplies reified entities unnecessarily.
    A FOL rule would be easy to construct to correctly relate the
    substances to their properties, but for COSMO version 0.2 a work-around
    for such a rule is not yet on hand.  The restrictions on substances
    should be interpreted as meaning necessary conditions on all subclasses
    of the substances.</rdfs:comment>

    >An AttributeValue is the actual value of some AttributeType possessed by some object,
    such as six feet for a length, or red for a color.  Individual AttributeValues are
    represented as Types (classes) in COSMO, not as instances.
    
      IMPORTANT NOTE:  the values represented by each of these AttributeValue Types are
      here viewed as a region ('Quality Space') in which the actual particular value 
      (see Type 'Quality') is located.  Thus one may say an object has a 'Red' color,
      but later refine the description to say it has a 'Fire Red' color.  The 'Fire Red' 
      is also a color region, contained within the 'Red' color region.

     For quantitative measures, representing attributes as classes allows approximate
     measures to be built in to the ontology itself.  One may specify a range
     for a measure, and any other measure within or overlapping that range can
     be considered as 'indistinguishable from' (not 'equal to') the other measure.
     
     NOTE: under consideration - the possibility of expressing the possession of
       an attribute for some interval of time by creating instances of AttributeValue
       or of Attribute that are also TimeSlices, with the time interval of the TimeSlice
       representing the time interval during which the Attribute was had.  This has an
       advantage over using timeSlice to creat 4D TimeSllices of an object, and
       then attributing an Attribute to it - in that one need not create new instances
       of an Object, which may not be easily associated with the 3D object.</rdfs:comment>

        all temperature measures are accurate to plus or minus one degree
        Fahrenheit - which might make sense in some applications.  A relative

        that every measure is accurate to within plus or minus one digit in the last 
        significant digit of the measure.  The 'plus or minus' range by default is
        the conventional variance, within which any measure has a 67% likelihood
        of being found.  The default variance will be used only if an
        explicit variance is not specified.
        
        The default variance can be set for each type of quantitative

    <rdfs:comment>A PopulationAttribute is any type of attribute
    that can be asserted about a group of people. It also is used
    to characterize geographical regions, in which case it 
    in fact characterizes the group of people who live in that region. 
    It will be time-sensitive, potentially varying rapidly.
    
    NOTE that this is a subclass of AttributeType, which categorizes
    general types of population attributes, and each PopulationAttribute
    The values for each PopulationAttribute will be a subtype of 
    PopulationCharacteristic.
    
     This AttributeType is mostly of interest for aggregate characteristics,
      such as 'RacialComposition'.

      be instances of 'PopulationCharacteristic' such as 
      'PercentageAsianAncestry'.</rdfs:comment>

 <owl:Class rdf:ID="PopulationCharacteristic">
    <rdfs:comment>An attribute of a 'Population' that is of interest to
      some group for some purpose.  Examples are: unemployment rate,
      dostribution of religious affiliations, racial distribution.
      The Population is usually human, but may be animal.  Plant
      groups are not included.  It may be quantitative or
      qualitative.  Quantitative characteristics will be instances of
      subtypes of 'PopulationAttributeValue'.
      
      A PopulationCharacteristic may also be used
          to characterize geographical regions, in which case it is interpreted
          as characterizing the group of people who live in that region. 
      It will be time-sensitive, potentially varying rapidly.
      
      The characteristic is often some percentage of the given
      population having a particular attribute, or some distribution of
      attribute values for one type of attribute.  Thus an 
      unemployment rate is a simple percentage under 100; a racial distribution is a
      group of fractions that add up to no more than 100% (if incomplete,
      it may add up to less than 100%).
      
      For qualitative attributes, one might characterize a population

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="Individual">
      <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
      >'Individual' is a  Cyc concept used to distinguish abstract sets
      and collections (classes) from things that are individuals.  Interestingly,
      groups of things can be individuals - if they are defined as distinct
      from sets (see 'Group').   This class may be superfluous, but in COSMO 
      is a convenient catch-all for some aggregate Types that would merely
      serve to clutter the top level and obscure the structure of the ontology 
      if exposed at the top level directly under 'Thing'.
      Conversely, Some of the subtypes of the Cyc 'individual' have also been
      subclassed  directly to 'owl:Thing' to expose those common concepts at the highest level,
      to make the structure of the ontology easier to see.
  
      NOTE that some of the concepts mentioned in the Cyc documnentation differ
      significantly in COSMO from related concepts in Cyc.  But the Cyc documentation is
      given here to describe how the similar Cyc notion of Group is described in
      that ontology.
               From OpenCyc:  OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
     #$Individual is the collection of all individuals: things that are _not_ sets
     or collections. Individuals might be concrete or abstract, and include 
     (among other things) physical objects, events, numbers, relations, and groups. 
     An instance of #$Individual might have parts or structure (including discontinuous parts); 
     but _no_ individual has elements or subsets (see #$elementOf and #$subsetOf).
     Thus, an individual that has parts (e.g. #$physicalParts or #$groupMembers) 
     is _not_ the same thing as either the set or the collection containing those
     same parts. For example, your car is an individual, but the collection of all 
     the parts of your car is not an individual but an instance of #$Collection. 
     This collection (unlike the car itself) is abstract: it doesn't have a location,
     mass, or a top speed; but it does have instances, subcollections, and supercollections. 
     In partial contrast, the #$Group (q.v.) of parts of your car (while also not
     the same thing as the car itself) _is_ an individual that has location and 
     mass. Another example: A given company, the group consisting of all the 
     company's employees, the collection of those employees, and the set of those 
     employees are four distinct things, and only the first two are individuals.</rdfs:comment>

     The collection of all spatial things, tangible or intangible,
     that can be meaningfully said to have location or position in the
     empirically observable universe of the context in question. This 
     includes all #$PartiallyTangible things, such as pyramids and ships,
     as well as certain #$Intangible spatial things, like the #$Equator. Also 
     included are all #$Events that can be pinned down to specific places 
     (see #$Event-Localized), and thus all #$PhysicalEvents. But note that many
     events are non-examples, such as the event of a certain law coming into
     effect and (presumably) purely mental events as well, at least in most 
     contexts. Also excluded are #$SpatialThings that are _not_ localized,
     such as purely abstract geometrical figures (e.g. a Platonic sphere).
     All instances of #$SpatialThing-Localized are temporal things, and thus 
     have finite lifespans (the upper bound of which is the lifespan of the 
     universe itself). Finally, note that imaginary entities like Frodo, 
     Captain Queeg, and #$HAL9000-TheComputer may be localized within
     the (imaginary) universes attaching to the fictitious contexts in which 
     they are defined, and so would be instances of #$SpatialThing-Localized
     within those microtheoretic contexts.
     
     NOTE: because Cyc 'SpatialThing-Localized' includes intangible
     spatial things, this is not identical to the purely physical
     objects such as 'Oject' in SUMO.  In COSMO,purely physical objects
     are categorized in the Type 'PhysicalObject', which is a subtype
     of this 'SpatialThing-Localized' category.</rdfs:comment>

     subrelations of this relation to be used in mapping database
     records to their creators.  The creators will sometimes be 
     represented in the database only as a string, and in such cases
     an implementing system, at its option, can avoid creating
     a new Person object (instead creating an AbstractString object),
     when the system cannot identify the 'creator' of the record.

    SUMO: A CorpuscularObject that is the product of a Making.

    Cyc comment for ;Artifact-HumanCreated':
        A collection of individual #$Artifacts. Each
              instance of #$Artifact-HumanCreated is a tangible thing made
              by an instance of #$HomoSapiens, or by a (#$GroupFn
              #$HomoSapiens). Examples include instances of
              #$Clothing-Generic, #$Automobile, #$DrainageCanal, and #$HydroelectricDam.

    OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
    A specialization of #$InanimateThing. Each instance of #$Artifact is an at least
    partially tangible thing which was intentionally created by an #$Agent (or a group
    of #$Agents working together) to serve some purpose or perform some function. In order
    to create an instance of #$Artifact, it is not necessary that an #$Agent create
    the matter out of which the #$Artifact is composed; rather, an #$Agent can create 
    an instance of #$Artifact by assembling or modifying existing matter. Examples of
    #$Artifacts include a wooden flute that's been whittled from a tree branch, a sawhorse 
    that's been put together out of boards and nails, and a coin that's been minted by
    embossing or by melting liquid silver into a mold. In addition to the obvious human 
    artifacts (buildings, tools, textiles, power lines), the collection #$Artifact also 
    includes certain sorts of things made by #$Animals, such as bird nests, termite mounds,
    and beaver dams. Artifacts without any tangible parts are excluded from the collection
    #$Artifact; they are included in the collection #$Artifact-Intangible.

    DOLCE: material-artifact: No easy definition of artifactual properties is possible,
    hence it is better to rely on alternative descriptions and roles: a physical object
    that shows or is known to have an artifactual origin that counts in the tasks an ontology 
    is supposed to support, will be a material artifact. On the other hand, physical objects
    that do not show that origin, or that origin is unimportant for the task of the ontology, 
    will be physical bodies. Formally, a restriction is provided here that requires that 
    the collection whose members are (at least some of the) proper parts of a material artifact
    is *unified* by a plan or project.</rdfs:comment>

<!-- 'Group' is an important concept in COSMO  -->

    <rdfs:comment>Every  Group consists of one or more entities considered as 
    one unit, and is related to the component entities by the relation 'hasComponentElement'.  
    A Group  is not an abstract or mathematical concept - every group derives its
    properties solely from the entities that are its component elements.  Thus
    a group of solid objects would be a solid object, and the mass of that object 
    would be equal to the sum of the masses of the component objects.  It has
    *some* similarity to the 'mereological sum' of mereologists.
    
    However, a Group may have component elements of very diverse kinds - there
    is no restriction on the membership of a Group, though one element can
    only count once in the cardinality of the group.  A Group is somewhat
    similar to a Cyc 'Group', but is not restricted to physical things, and
    has relations to its members named differently than in Cyc.
    
    NOTE: A Group that has one component element is identical to that single element; in this respect
    it is similar to the mereological notion of a 'mereological sum'.  The only group
    that can have itself as a component element is the group of one element.  This 
    latter property is the peculiar characteristic of this concept of 'Group',
    in contrast to other aggregates except, as noted, for 'mereological sum'.
    
    This concept of 'Group' makes certain representations covenient. In some cases,
    we want to deine a finction that may return one or more elements, but if there
    is one element, we also want that single element to be identical to the single element,
    and not encapsulated in an enveloping element.  Returning a Group will allow that behavior.
    
    Cyc Documentation for 'Group' (NOTE some differences from COSMO 'Group')
    OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
    A collection of temporal objects. Each instance of #$Group is a composite object
    made up of one or more individual objects or events. A group is related to each
    of its members by the predicate #$groupMembers (q.v.) [COSMO: 'hasComponentElement']
    Note that instances of #$Group are _not_ collections. 
    A group has temporal extent [COSMO: a Group may be abstract] and might have spatial
    location, while a collection is timeless and nonspatial. It is of course possible 
    to define a collection parallel to any given group, so that the instances of the 
    collection are exactly the group-members of that group; e.g. each toe on my left 
    foot (and nothing else) is both an instance of the collection of my left toes and 
    a member of the group of toes on my left foot. But that group (of my left toes)
    is a spatiotemporal thing while the correlated collection (of my left toes) is not.
    Similarly, if a certain flock of pigeons is considered as having a location, a spatial 
    extent, and a time of existence, then the flock is being considered a _group_ and not
    a collection. Finally, unlike a collection, a group cannot be empty, but must
    have _at_least_one_ group-member. As a default, a group whose group-members all 
    are instances of #$SomethingExisting is itself an instance of #$SomethingExisting, 
    and a group whose group-members all are #$Events is itself an #$Event. Instances 
    of #$Group include #$QueensGuard, #$ThreeWiseMen, #$SantasReindeer, and
    #$InternationalCommunity.

      It is the inverse of 'hasComponentElement'.  Since Groups
      are not defined arbitrarily, and seldom defined automatically, this relation

    NOTE: in COSMO, Group is restricted to groupings of at least
        one entity, as in OpenCyc.  In this manner PluralThing stays closer to the 
        linguistic intuition of a plural.  A more generic Group that is not a

        NOTE: BFO has the notion of an 'ObjectAggregate' which is similar

        than for COSMO 'Group', since a COSMO 'Group' can be composed of arbitarily
        defined components, whereas in BFO each 'Object' of the aggregate
        must be an object with perceptible boundaries. Since BFO 'Object' 
        is disjoint from 'fiat object part' and from ObjectAggregate,
        we need to make 'ObjectAggregate' a subtype of 'PluralThing',

    <rdfs:comment>An Entity that has a beginning point in time and an ending point in time.
    
      The usage of this term in COSMO differs from the usage in OpenCyc, in that it
      does **not** include PhysicalObject as a subtype, though the two categories are
      not disjoint.  The purpose of the cyc concept
      appears to be to permit relating both PhysicalObjects and Events
      to their time location.  In COSMO, that purpose is served by the relation
      'hasTemporalLocation' (which see) which has as its domain the union of 
      Events and PhysicalObjects.and 'wasCreatedDuring' and 'wasDestroyedDuring',
      
      There is, however, a subtle issue in that the beginning and ending
      time of a 'TemporalThing' may be the same time, i.e. the
      instance may be an instantaneous time slice of a time-extended
      entity.  Since in COSMO zero-interval extended entities
      are indistinguishable from point entities, this means that
      a '3-D' endurantist object can be an instance of 'TemporalThing'
      just as a HumanRole, a '4-D' perdurantist object can be an
      instance of the typically '3-D' Person.
      
      In Opencyc a 'TemporalThing' is very generic, it is anything that has 
      a beginning point in time (and presumably an ending point, though it
      may not be known for existing things).  Thus physical objects, which 
      must come into existence at some time (perhaps the beginning of time), as well
      as events, are 'TemporalThings'.  In COSMO, TemporalThing is reserved
      for TimeIntervals and Events, and PhysicalObjects are not classified as
      subtypes of TemporalThing.  The creation and destruction time of 
      PhysicalObjects will use different relations.

      OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
        The collection of all things that have temporal extent or location, i.e. things 
        about which one might sensibly ask When? . #$TemporalThing thus contains many kinds
        of things, including events, physical objects, agreements, and abstract pieces of time.
        Note that #$TimePoint is a specialization of #$TemporalThing, since time points
        have temporal location, although they arguably lack temporal extent.
        Abstract things that are timeless - such as mathematical sets, attributes,
        and numbers - are of course _not_ instances of #$TemporalThing.
        
        NOTE that although every TemporalThing must have a starting and ending
        TimePont, that notion is not represented as an existential
        restriction so that it will not be necessary to explicitly
        represent the starting and ending times of intervals whose
        starting and ending times can be calculated from the name.
        This is a pragmatic and implementational, not a theoretical
        consideration.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#TemporalThing"/>
    <rdfs:comment>A TimeSlice is a temporal part of some entity - a PhysicalObject
      Role, or GenericLocation.  In a four-dimensional (perdurantism) treatment of objects,
      this would be a part of a four-dimensional object.  Every TimeSlice has
      a time at which it begins and a time at which it ends, specified by
      'hasStartingTimePoint' and 'hasEndingTimePoint'.  Because a TimeSlice
      is not disjoint with anything else, this allows one to create
      four-dimensional time slices of physical objects (or phycial locations)
      by creating an instance of an object that is also an instance of a
      TimeSlice, and spcifying the beginning and ending time points.  Such an
      object could be used as an argument in a binary relation, thereby including 
      the intended time interval in the relation.
      
      This usage creates an interpretation of entities in this ontology
      that may seem at variance with both the traditional 'endurantist'
      and 'perdurantist' interpretations.  It is closer to the 
      'perdurantist' in that the object without specification of
      its time slice may be interpreted as the whole-life object, but there
      is a major difference: the COSMO leaves open the possibility of
      specifying that a relation on an object holds during some interval
      of time - and that is not consistent with traditional four-dimensionalist
      usage.  The COSMO usage permits more flexibility in the way relations
      can be specified within temporal boundaries.</rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:comment>COSMO: SituationProcessEventOrState is a broad category that
     includes Events, FunctionalProcesses, and  PersistentStates,all of which are 
     different aspects of the same fundamental conceptual entity, commonly
     called an 'Event'.  Each Event is a Group containing the component elements:
       (1) InstantaneousState at the starting time
       (2) InstantaneousState at the Ending time
       (3) The FunctionalProcess that describes the intermediate states between the starting and ending times.

      **Informally**, a state,process, or event is interpreted as the set of
       *values* of some 'fluents' (attributes or relations that may change over time),
       but the actual *formal* representation is a Group in which the group elements 
       are the *LinguisticAssertions* specifying the values of the fluents  
       pertaining to some Group of Objects.  Each LinguisticAssertion specifies
       the value at some time point (or time interval).  The differences in 
       State, Process,and Event are:
        State: The Group of Assertions that hold at one time point (InstantaneousState),
           or persist without change of value over some contiguous interval
           of time (PersistentState).  No value can chage within a State.
        FunctionalProcess: The full set of LinguisticAssertions specifying the values of
           fluents at each time point or smaller TimeInterval
           within a TimeInterval in which the Process is defined.  The set of
           LinguisticAssertions relate times to values,and in that respect is
           analogous to a mathematical function.  In analogy to a mathematical
           function, one can derive a 'rate' for a Process (in cases where
           the values are quantified) by taking the ratio of (difference in
           value) to (difference in time) for any TimeInterval in which a change
           of value is specified.  This rate may change from time to time
           during a FunctionalProcess.
        Event: focuses on the values of the fluents at the beginning and ending of some
          TimeInterval, but also includes the FunctionalProcess that specifies
          the fluent values at times between the beginning and ending.  Since the
          focus of an Event is on the change from one time point to the next, 
          one cannot specify a 'rate' in the same sense as for a FunctionalProcess,
          where the rate may change many times during the FunctionalProcess.
          For an Event, one can derive a single 'rate' value that specifies the overall
          ratio of change of fluent value to time, between the beginning
          and ending points, and for an Event, only one such 'rate' can be
          defined.
           
    
    NOTE: In COSMO a Situation is classified as a CompositeConcept because 
    it is considered as a composite of the InstantaneousStates at the beginning
    and ending times of the Situation (which can be the same time), plus the 
    FunctionalProcess that describes the states intermediate between the 
    beginning and ending times.

   ***** Special COSMO NOTE on BFO 'ProcessualEntity' *****************************
   In BFO the Type 'ProcessualEntity' appears to be most closely similar to
     COSMO 'SituationProcessEventOrState'.  However, the division of the BFO
     Type into 'FiatProcessPart' and 'Process' has no corresponding 
     division in Cyc or SUMO.  In COSMO we include a FiatProcessPart for
     compatibility, but do not use it (no subtypes), and do not use the BFO partition
     of 'ProcessualEntity'.   
   
      BFO Definition: An occurrent that exists in time by occurring or happening,
         has temporal parts and always involves and depends on some SNAP entity.
       
         Examples: the life of an organism, the process of meiosis, the course of a disease,
      the flight of a bird
   
   ***** End Special NOTE on BFO 'ProcessualEntity' *****************************
   
   Cyc 'Situation' is indistinguishable from 'Situation-Temporal' except
        for the possible inclusion in 'Situation' of abstract situations
        not enclosed in a time interval.  The term 'Situation' has been
        interpreted in COSMO as strictly temporal, and the more abstract things that
        resenble situations have been aggregated under 'AbstractEvent'.
        
     Cyc ('Situtation') A subcollection of both #$IntangibleIndividual and
               #$TemporalThing. #$Situation subsumes #$Event and
               #$StaticSituation. Each instance of #$Situation is a state
               or event consisting of one or more objects having certain
               properties, or bearing certain relations to each other.
            

   OPENCYC 1: (Situation-Temporal) MAY 23, 2002
   A subcollection of both #$Situation and #$TemporalThing. #$Situation-Temporal
   is the collection of all instances of #$Situation that have duration or other temporal
   properties . Thus, #$Situation-Temporal subsumes #$Event and #$StaticSituation,
   as well as some other specializations of #$Situation. It does _not_ subsume any 
   specializations of #$Situation that have atemporal instances.

  DOLCE: Perdurants (AKA occurrences) comprise what are variously called events,
    processes, phenomena, activities and states. They can have temporal parts or 
    spatial parts. For instance, the first movement of (an execution of) a symphony 
    is a temporal part of the symphony. On the other hand, the play performed by 
    the left side of the orchestra is a spatial part. In both cases, these parts 
    are occurrences themselves. We assume that objects cannot be parts of
    occurrences, but rather they participate in them. Perdurants extend in time 
    by accumulating different temporal parts, so that, at any time they are present,
    they are only partially present, in  the sense that some of their proper 
    temporal parts (e.g., their previous or future phases) may be not present. 
    E.g., the piece of paper you are reading now is wholly present, while some 
    temporal parts of your reading are not present yet, or any more. Philosophers 
    say that endurants are entities that are in time, while lacking temporal parts
    (so to speak, all their parts flow with them in time). Perdurants, on the contrary,
    are entities that happen in time, and can have temporal parts (all their parts 
    are fixed in time).</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>Each Event in COSMO is a Group representing the changes to the 
      properties (attributes and relations) of one or more objects over some
      interval of time, and containing the component elements:
         (1) InstantaneousState at the starting time
         (2) InstantaneousState at the Ending time
         (3) The FunctionalProcess that describes the intermediate states

      **Informally**, a state,process, or event in COSMO is interpreted as the set of
       *values* of some 'fluents' (attributes or relations that may change over time),
       but the actual *formal* representation is a Group in which the group elements 
       are the *LinguisticAssertions* specifying the values of the fluents  
       pertaining to some Group of Objects.  Each LinguisticAssertion specifies
       the value at some time point (or time interval).  The differences in 
       State, Process,and Event are:
        State: The Group of Assertions that hold at one time point (InstantaneousState),
           or persist without change of value over some contiguous interval
           of time (PersistentState).  No value can chage within a State.
        FunctionalProcess: The full set of LinguisticAssertions specifying the values of
           fluents at each time point or smaller TimeInterval
           within a TimeInterval in which the Process is defined.  The set of
           LinguisticAssertions relate times to values,and in that respect is
           analogous to a mathematical function.  In analogy to a mathematical
           function, one can derive a 'rate' for a Process (in cases where
           the values are quantified) by taking the ratio of (difference in
           value) to (difference in time) for any TimeInterval in which a change
           of value is specified.  This rate may change from time to time
           during a FunctionalProcess.
        Event: focuses on the values of the fluents at the beginning and ending of some
          TimeInterval, but also includes the FunctionalProcess that specifies
          the fluent values at times between the beginning and ending.  Since the
          focus of an Event is on the change from one time point to the next, 
          one cannot specify a 'rate' in the same sense as for a FunctionalProcess,
          where the rate may change many times during the FunctionalProcess.
          For an Event, one can derive a single 'rate' value that specifies the overall
          ratio of change of fluent value to time, between the beginning
          and ending points, and for an Event, only one such 'rate' can be
          defined.
           
                
      Although logically included in each Event are the starting and ending times,
       (see relations hasStartingTimePoint and hasEndingTimePoint), these may not be
       known, and creating an instance of Event does not require specifying those
       times if not known.
      
       NOTE that the FunctionalProcess which is a component of the Event *contains*
         all of the elements contained in the Event, in that it contains itself,
         and also contains the states at the beginning and end.  While *containing* all of
         those elements, however, it is nevertheless a distinctly different concept,
         since the 'Event' specifically selects out of the FunctionalProcess the 
         beginning and ending states as characteristic of the Event.  The Event
         is not a FunctionalProcess, but *contains* a FunctionalProcess as a
         component element.  A FunctionalProcess can be derived from an Event, and
         an Event can be derived from a FunctionalProcess that is defined over
         some interval of time.  A 'FunctionalProcess' that has only one time point
         in it also represents a special kind of Event, the limiting case
         of an InstantaneousState.  NOTE also that an instance of FunctionalProcess
         that is defined by a mathematical function relating properties to time
         must have associated with it some time interval during which it is asserted to
         be valid, in order to be an instance.
         
       NOTE also that this representation of Event does not resemble a
       perdurantist 'history' which focuses on some region of space-time.
       Regions of space-time are represented as 'SpatiotemporalRegion' in
       COSMO, but the only spatial regions of relevance to an Event are those
       that can be derived from the locations of the Objects that participate
       in an Event.  The significant conceptual components of an Event are the
       properties ('fluents') of the Objects that participate in the Event,
       and insofar as the locations of the Objects may be, but are not necessarily,
       represented in the Event, those locations may be significant, but except in
       Events solely depicting motion, the locations are incidental rather than central
       to the changes represented by the Event.

      
      Each Event represents one or more changes that occur to
    the attributes  or relations ('fluents') of one or more objects during 
    some defined interval of time (or for abstract Events, within some
    interval on the dimension of causality); the net changes are
    represented by the state at the beginning of the event and the state at the
    end of the Event.  In the physical world, real Events typically
    have multiple intermediate stages, and nothing occurs instantaneously,
    but some non-physical Events such as a change of title for a Person may
    occur at a precise moment by prior arrangement.
       The representation of intermediate stages of an Event can be explicit, with the
    included events related to the whole event by the 'hasSubEvent' relation or
    'hasTemporalPart' relation.  The first can be more specific about one
    of serveral fluents that vary during an event. The temporal part relation
    between Events must relate a subevent that includes alll of the fluents 
    represented in the whole Event.
    
    Each Event includes implicitly a Process that specifies the course of each
    fluent between the start and end times.  At this point (v0.39) there is
    no explicit representation of the included Process, but each FunctionalProcess
    will, if represented explicitly, have an associate time granularity indicating
    the minimal intervals over which the change in the fluents are represented.
    The ize of the granularity intervals during which FunctionalProcess states
    are represented will depends on the discretion of the ontologist for the
    pruposes of the representation.
    
    COSMO note: note that in some ontologies (and situation logics) , 'Event'
    is used to refer to a change in state that is considered instantaneous.
    In COSMO, suchan 'Event' is a subtype of the more general event, which is a 
    change in state that occurs over some interval of time (which,
    for instantaneous changes would be a zero-length time interval). 
    
    NOTE also that for some Events, such as cyclic Events, merely representing
    the starting and ending states - which may be identical - loses the
    whole meaning of the Event; so intermediate states must also be
    represented in some manner to provide meaning to the Event.

          Event was 'facilitated' does not require that the Event would not
          have been possible without the instrument.
          
          In SUMO a similar relation is called 'instrument'
          SUMO: (instrument ?EVENT ?TOOL) means that ?TOOL 
           is used by an agent in bringing about ?EVENT and that ?TOOL is not 
           changed by ?EVENT.  For example, the key is an instrument in the 
           following proposition: The key opened the door.  Note that instrument 
           and resource cannot be satisfied by the same ordered pair.
       
         In Cyc a similar relation is called 'deviceUsed'
          Cyc:  The predicate #$deviceUsed relates an event to a
            device used in that event. (#$deviceUsed EVENT OBJECT) means
            that the #$PhysicalDevice OBJECT plays an instrumental role
            in the #$Event EVENT (see the more generalized predicate
            #$instrument-Generic), OBJECT is intentionally used in
            EVENT, and standardly (for example, in the
            #$HumanActivitiesMt) OBJECT's role in EVENT is
            consistent with the object's #$primaryFunction.</rdfs:comment>

         Cyc: A collection of events.  Each instance of

            mental functions of  a participant or group of participants

            things as dreaming, perceiving, sensing, theorizing about

            something, designing something, and consciously carrying out

            events and non-purposeful events that involve mental
            functions.  Note also that any event that has a mental
            component is also an instance of this collection, so that
            events like preparing lunch would be classified as instances
            of #$AtLeastPartiallyMentalEvent.  In entering knowledge, it
            is almost always possible and preferable to use one of the
            specializations of #$AtLeastPartiallyMentalEvent.  If an

    >COSMO note: DOLCE distinguishes Events that have temporal parts with 
    similar character, i.e. the same sort of thing occurs throughout 
    the tie interval of the Event.  In OpenCyc, such 'homogeneous' events 
    are represented using 'StuffType' metaclasses.  A special subclass 
    is the 'State' where nothing happens over some time interval. 
    'State' is an important concept in PSL and situation calculus.

    DOLCE: An occurrence-type is stative or eventive according  to whether
    it holds of the mereological sum of two of its instances, i.e.
     if it is  cumulative or not.
     A sitting occurrence is stative since the sum of two sittings  is still a
     sitting occurrence.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A PersistentState is an Event
    in which all relevant attributes or relations
    (any one or more 'fluents' in PSL) remains constant over some time interval.
    A special limiting subtype would be an InstaneousState, for which 
    the time interval is of zero duration.
    
     COSMO note:  DOLCE has a convoluted description of
     what a 'State' is.  For COSMO, a PersistentState (what appears to be
     a 'State' in DOLCE) it is very simply an Event
     in which nothing changes over some interval of time
     - - i.e. nothing changes that the knowledge 
     enterer considers significant for her/his purposes.  This can be 
     viewed as the limiting case of an Event, in which so little 
     of significance happens that it is not worth mentioning.

     DOLCE: Within stative occurrences, we distinguish between 
     states and processes according to homeomericity: sitting is 
     classified as a state  but running is classified as a process,
     since there are (very short) temporal parts  of a running that 
     are not themselves runnings.In general, states differ from situations 
     because they are not assumed to have a description from which they depend. 
     They can be sequenced by some course, but they do not require a 
     description as a unifying criterion.On the other hand, at any time,
     one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which 
     a state of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes
     a situation.Since the decision of designing an explicit description 
     that unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, 
     application, etc., when aligning an ontology to DLP, there can be 
     indecision on where to align a state-oriented class. 
     For example, in the WordNet alignment, we have decided to put only 
     some physical states under 'state', e.g. 'turgor', in order to 
     stress the social orientedness of DLP. But whereas we need 
     to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive turgor states,
     these will be put under 'situation'.Similar considerations are made for 
     the other types of perdurants in DOLCE.A different notion of event
     (dealing with change) is currently investigated for further developments:
     being 'achievement', 'accomplishment', 'state', 'event', etc. can 
     be also considered 'aspects' of processes or of parts of them. For example, the same process 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley' can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought the current state that e.g. we are trying to explain), as an achievement (the erosion process as the result of a previous accomplishment), as a state (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as an event (what has changed our focus from a state to another).In the erosion case, we could have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) condensation d) transition (causality).If we want to consider all the aspects of a process together, we need to postulate a unifying descriptive set of criteria (i.e. a 'description'), according to which that process is circumstantiated in a 'situation'. The different aspects will arise as a parts of a same situation.

    <rdfs:comment>'State' is an ambiguous term with at least two frequently used
      but different meanings; it is synonymous with two terms:
      (1) PersistentState: A state of affairs that persists over some period
     of time is what is most commonly referred to as a 'state',
     if one includes the special case where the interval is zero,
     i.e. the 'state' is the state at a particular moment.
     (2) A Nation, or the first administrative subdivision of a Nation..

        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note:  This concept is similar to 
          DOLCE 'Stative' but we make it temporarily (v0.2) a
          parent class of the DOLCE concept.
          
          Cyc:  A specialization of #$Situation.  Each instance of
            #$StaticSituation is a state of affairs between two or more
            things, persisting statically over some time interval.
            Instances of #$StaticSituation always have a temporal
            extent, and they usually have a tangible and spatial extent.
            As an example, consider the situation of Bill Clinton
            sitting in his easy chair on the evening of 7/4/96.   There
            are participant objects such as Bill and the chair, there
            are relationships such as the seat of the chair supporting
            his bottom and his weight being off his feet, etc.   In any
            #$StaticSituation, for the participants in that situation,
            there is some significant or focal relationship between them
            which does not change.  In the most typical cases, there is
            no important change whatsoever, e.g. someone sitting would
            be such a #$StaticSituation. But some things represented as
            #$StaticSituations can alternatively be represented as
            #$Events.  For example, a situation in which geese were
            flying in a flock would be static (the flock-like spatial
            relationship between the  geese would be retained) but it
            would also be dynamic in that the geese were moving, so
            either representation could be chosen depending on the context.</rdfs:comment>

 <owl:Class rdf:ID="DevelopmentProcess">
        <rdfs:comment>A very general concept, aggregating all
        the FunctionalProcesses that can be described as
        'Development'.  This is the actual process of
        something developing, not a procedure or plan or protocol
        for development of something.  Development can be
        natural, as in development of an embryo, or a human
        actiity, such as development of a language or
        culture.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="FunctionalProcess">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#SituationProcessEventOrState"/>
    <owl:disjointWith rdf:resource="#Event"/>
    <rdfs:comment>A FunctionalProcess corresponds to the linguistic intuition
     of something happening at some point in time, rather than something that
     has happened in some interval of time, which is an Event.  Intuitively,
     it may be considered as the time derivative of an Event: a Process 
     occurring over some interval of time gives rise to an Event, which 
     is a change (or series of changes) in the properties of some
     Objects during some interval of Time.  Every FunctionalProcess is
     intimately associated with some Event as one of the comonents of that
     Event (see 'Event').
     
     Formally, a FunctionalProcess is a Group consisting of ordered pairs,
     each ordered pair having one element which is an InstantaneousState at
     some time point and the second element being the TimePoint at which that state
     holds.  Each InstantaneousState contains the Group of values of the Fluents that 
     hold at that TimePoint.
        Thus if, at some point in time, someone is Running, one can say that
     a Running process exists at that point, and that person is a participant in the process.
     The 'existence' of an instance of Process at some time point implies that
     some Event has taken place (or is taking place) in the time interval
     including that time point, and vice-versa, each Event implies existence
     of some corresponding FunctionalProcess at every time point during the 
     interval between the beginning and end of the Event (**but see next paragraph**).
     But for linguistic purposes, it may be more convenient to represent
     just the Event or just the FunctionalProcess, and not explicitly represent the
     corresponding entity, which is nevertheless implied.

           The list of States over time has some similarity to a 
            ValueTimeEntry, though the former relates the state
            assertions themselves, rather than the values.    

     **It is possible for a FunctionalProcess to be discontinuous, such as an 'eating'
     process during which one is not actually ingesting anything - perhaps reading
     a paper in the intervals between taking bites of a meal; or a 'going to school'
     process during which one sleeps, watches television, etc., other than actually being 
     in the school or studying.  One may formally say that the process continues
     int the intervals when the relevant fluents are not changing, but that 
     the intervals between actual progression of the process each consists of 
     a null process which is part of the whole process, and give rise to null events which
     are parts of the whole event.**

     The term 'process' has been often used to refer to Procedures,
     (see 'Procedure') which are specifications for some sequence of actions
     that accomplish a goal.  That is a distinct, though somewhat related
     concept.
        In some ontologies, (such as Cyc) a 'process' is a type of Event which has
     some uniform character throughout the Event.  Because of the variant usage,
     the bare term 'process' is not used in this ontology to avoid confusion.
     Thus this base Type is called 'FunctionalProcess' to specifically refer to
     its similarity to a mathematical function.  It resembles a mathematical
     function in certain respects: a FunctionalProcess can be said to describe 
     the state of some system as a function of time.  Like a function, 
     a FunctionalProcess can have properties, and one important property will
     be the Rate at which the represented change is occurring.

     Most ontologies deal with Events, and ignore Processes of this type.
     For representing certain  linguistic phrases, however, this type is better 
     suited than the Event type.  Most FunctionalProcesses are not
     represented explicitly in COSMO at version 0.3, but when needed
     may be generated by a function (not yet defined) that takes an
     Event and returns the Process that is operating to generate that Event.
     One issue not yet dealt with in COSMO v0.3 is whether a function that can
     generate a Process from the corresponding Event can handle Events
     whose definition specifies more than one Fluent as changing during the
     Event.  In such cases, to have a clear relation, the multiple fluents
     must be ordered similarly in the representation of the Event 
     and its corresponding FunctionalProcess.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="hasCorrespondingProcess">
    <rdfs:comment>hasCorrespondingProcess relates an Event (or eventType) to
      the FunctionalProcess (or ProcessType) which gives rise to the Event
      over some interval of time (or more abstractly, some interval
      on the dimension of causality).  NOTE that this relation can
      be used at either the instance or Type level, and can be used in
      a mixed mode, to specify that a particular Event was produced by
      a particular Type of Process.  This relation is not
      yet elaborated in COSMO v0.3, and serves mostly as a placeholder
      to clarify (somewhat) the relation between Event and FunctionalProcess..</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="Action">
        <rdfs:comment>An Event in which some Agent plays a causative role.
          NOTE that an Agent may cause an action indirectly and with a 
          time delay, via some device - and that action, controlled largely 
          by the device, is still considered as an Action of that Agent in COSMO.
          This means that the 'action' set in motion by an Agent may continue
          even after the death of the Agent. Thus, the fire in an oil burner,
          being controlled by the Agent that controls the oil burner, is considered 
          as an Action here, even though the burner continues for a long time automatically.
          The Action in such cases of indirect and delayed effects extends from the
          time at which the Agent started the action until the end of the time
          when the predictable immediate consequences occur.
          At some point it will probably be worthwhile distinguishing
          the Action of setting a Device from the Events controlled by the
          device, but as of v0.43 that distinction is not encoded.
          
          For Actions directly including only the immediate motion of an animal
          and its direct, almost simultaneous consequences, use 'AnimalActivity'.

         NOTE that a MentalEvent such as a feeling or Emotion is also
         considered an Action,as it is performed by a CognitiveAgent.

        In different ontologies, the same notion has different names:        
          Action(Cyc) IntentionalProcess (SUMO) action(DOLCE) Activity(ISO15926).
        
        NOTE: in COSMO we classify an 'Experience' as a subtype of 
        'Action' to indicate that the focus of the subject is an
        Agent, even though no Events external to the Agent may 
        be caused by the Experience.
 
        Cyc comment:  The collection of #$Events (q.v.) that are carried
            out by some  doer  (see #$doneBy).  Instances of #$Action
            include any event in which one or more actors effect some
            change in the (tangible or intangible) state of the world,
            typically by an expenditure of effort or energy.  Note that
            it is not required that any tangible object be moved,
            changed, produced, or destroyed for an action to occur; the
            effects of an action might be intangible (such as a change
            in a bank balance or the intimidation of a subordinate).
            Note also that the doer of an action, though typically an
            #$Agent (q.v.), need not be (e.g. a falling rock that dents
            a car's roof).  Depending upon the context, doers of
            actions might be animate or inanimate, conscious or
            nonconscious.  For actions that are intentional, see
            #$PurposefulAction and #$performedBy.

         DOLCE: A Perdurant that exemplifies the intentionality of an agent.
         Could it be aborted, incomplete, mislead, while remaining a (potential)
         accomplishment ... The point here is that having a result depends on a method,
         then an action remains an action under incomplete results. As a matter of fact, 
         if we neutralize intentionality, a purely topological, post-hoc view is
         at odds with the notion of incomplete accomplishments.</rdfs:comment>

	<rdfs:comment>A specialization of both
            #$AtLeastPartiallyMentalEvent and
            #$IntentionalMentalSituation (qq.v.).  This is the
            collection of (at least partially) mental events whose
            instances are characterized by intentionality: they are  of
            or  about  some thing external to themselves.  Thoughts and
            acts of perception are two common types of intentional
            mental events.  Thus, a particular act of thinking about the
            Eiffel Tower and a particular act of seeing the Eiffel Tower
            are both intentional mental events, each having (at least)
            the Eiffel Tower as their object.  Any thing whatsoever can
            in principle be the object of an intentional mental event: I
            can think about a certain physical object, an #$Event, a
            #$Relation, an attribute, a #$Proposition, a mental state
            (my own or another's), a set, a #$Collection, or
            anything else.  Mental events that are _not_ intentional,
            and thus not in this collection, include non-localized pain
            experiences, and at least some instances of
            #$ExperiencingEmotion (q.v.).   Note that, although they are
            indirectly related (see e.g. #$PurposefulMentalActivity),
            the sense of  intentional  described above is not to be
            confused with its other sense as an antonym of  accidental .
            Nor is it to be confused with the logico-semantic concept of
            _intensional_ meaning.  See also  #$IntentionalMentalState,

        Cyc: An Event in which a CognitiveAgent participates

        something.  The Learning in an Experience is a result
        not merely of interpreting the content of a Communication,
        but from sense impressions or invoked responses other than
        the sense impressions required to interpret a communication.
        As a borderline included case, it is possible to say
        that a person has an 'Experience' in reading a book, 
        because the book evoked emotions; in this case the 
        'Experience' includes the evoking of the emotions, not
        merely the interpretation of the content.  A person may 
        also have an 'Experience' in a conversation by observig
        how the others in the conversation react to events in
        the conversation.
        
        An Experience will include a Perceiving event and
           a Reaction event.
        From Random House Webster:
          'the process or fact of personally observing, encountering,
        or undergoing something: [e.g.] business experience.'
    
        NOTE: in COSMO we classify an 'Experience' as a subtype of 
        'Action' to indicate that the focus of the subject is an
        Agent, even though no Events external to the Agent may

     On the other hand, a purely physical phenomenon does not seem

    <rdfs:comment>A MentalObject is an Object that does not have mass and was created
      by an IntelligentAgent (usually a Person.or Organization).  This is a very
      broad and primitive category comprehensible mostly by inspection of
      a list of subtypes.  Since this is not physical, instances of this
      Type are not observable, but physical representations of instances
      of this Type (such as a specific copy of 'Gone With the Wind') can
      be weighed and felt.
         Abstract texts, musical compositions, propositions, theories, plays, poems,
      speeches, rights - all are MentalObjects.  They will invariably have a physical
      representation in some PhysicalObject (including brains, light waves and sound waves).
      But the MentalObject itself has no physical (material) component.    This corresponds 
      closely to what in some systems (e.g. the Ontology Works top ontology) is called an
      'AbstractArtifact' - something created by a  Person that is not a PhysicalObject.

     We adopt the convention that an individual MentalObject exists only so long as there 
  is some PhysicalObject that represents it.  That PhysicalObject could be the brain 
  of a Person, some sound or electromagnetic waves encoding that MentalObject, or 
  some piece of paper with markings on it.  When the last physical object representing 
  that MentalObject ceases to exist, that MentalObject also ceases to exist.  A new
  MentalObject indistinguishable from a previously existing one can always be created 
  (even by the original creator), but it would be a different individual with a 
  different identity.
  
  NOTE that a MentalObject is a subtype of 'AbstractEntity', but we adopt the convention that 
  it can hava a location in space-time, being the collection of locations where its physical
  representations are located.  Thus a Belief or a Proposition may be located in the brain of
  one or more IntelligentAgents, or in physical documents describing the belief symbolically.
  This 'location' differs from the location of any individual physical object, because
  the location is the collection of all physical objects containing representations of 
  the Mental Object.   This notion of 'abstract' is not the same as the traditional 'abstract' which cannot be 
  located in space-time.  Other subtypes of 'AbstractEntity' such as MathemaitcalObjects 
  will be more traditionally abstract in that way.  An idiosyncratic 'location' for a 
  MentalObject is the location of a GeopoliticalEntity, which is located in the region
  controlled by the GeopoliticalEntity.

            #$AwardPractice is a distinction bestowed upon someone or
            something by an appropriately authorized agent, generally in

            a competitive process.  Awards may be given to people,
            books, buildings, cities, etc.  Note that this collection
            represents the awards themselves rather than tangible
            symbols of awards, such as medals or Oscar statuettes.  Nor

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Right">
    <rdfs:comment>A MentalObject that relates two or more IntelligentAgents in such a
     way that the Agent that has the Right may do something that affects the other Agent,
     without creating a right for the other Agent.  This is a primitive concept.
     The Right refers to some future Sitation (action, event, state) that the
     Agent having the Right may cause to occur.

     The Random House Webster describes this sense of 'right' as:
       'that which is due to anyone by just claim, legal guarantees, moral principles, etc.'

     A Right is in some sense an inverse of Obligation, in that failure to perform an
     Obligation can incur negative consequences for an Agent with an Obligation,
     whereas in theory having a Right should allow an Agent to perform an act
     without direct negative social consequences from the Agent against whom a Right
     is held.  For certain types of Right, not having a Right implies an Obligation
     not to do the action that is the subject of the Right.
     
     Whereas an Obligation is created by an Authority, a Right can
     be created by simple  unilateral permission, negotiation, payment, or by dint of a
     situation such as  being born  in a particular place.  Nevertheless, a Right always 
     involves some other Agent (which can be as abstract as God or one's own  conscience),
     otherwise the alternative of not having a Right would incur no negative consequence on 
     performing the action.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>The Right to ownership of private property.  This 'Right' is
    not universally acknowledged (as in Communist countries), and is restricgted
    by other rights like eminent domain.
    
    'Property' in Yale OCM (420) appears to be similar in meaning::
            
    OCM: General statements dealing with several of the specific aspects 
           of the property system.  Material concerning the property system as a whole 
           will be filed in Category 421. The term 'property' is to be distinguished 
           from wealth, material possessions, or any object of ownership. It is
           to be understood only in the strict technical sense of the jural relations
           of people with regard to some subject matter and governing the use and enjoyment
           of the latter. In precise usage, a 'right' is correlated with a 'duty' (if A has a
           right against B, B is under a corresponding duty toward A); a 'privilege' is 
           correlated with 'no right' (if A has a privilege as against B, B has no right 
           against A, instead of a duty); a 'power' is correlated with 'liability' (if A 
           has a power as against B, B is under a liability that his jural relations may 
           be changed by a voluntary act on the past of A). A 'title' is a
           distinct constellation of rights, privileges, and powers with respect to some 
           subject matter. A 'type of ownership' refers to the social composition of the 
           holders of a title, e.g., an individual, a partnership, a clan, a corporation, 
           a state. A 'property transaction' is an act which transfers a title
           to a new owner. A "property system" consists of every type of title, ownership, 
           and property transaction recognized by a society with respect to all culturally 
           defined classes of subject matter, and is not dependent upon the statistical 
           frequency with which its constituent elements manifest themselves..</rdfs:comment>

     COSMO:  GenericSubstance is an abstract notion of Substance as the stuff of
     which objects are composed.  It is not an object, even though 'Substance' 
     in OpenCyc and SUMO are actually objects of some particular (homogeneous)
     composition.  In COSMO, we make this provision, among other reasons,
     to allow abstract 'substances' to compose abstract objects.
     In COSMO 'Subtance' is a concept that is analogous to the derivative
     of an object with respect to volume, i.e. it acts like an abstract density 
     (of some substance type).  For COSMO version 0.01 (COSMOtopOWL03: 2006-01-01)
     the required axioms for a proper definition have not been added.

    >A PhysicalSubstance includes any of the common 'substances' we encounter every  day:
    water, air, sugar, salt, coffee (ground or as a drink), beer, meat, steel, plastic, etc.
    This concept must not be construed as a physical object made of some substance.  
    PhysicalObjects which are relatively homogeneous (the atmosphere, the ocean) can be
    construed as consisting of one or more PhysicalSubstances.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: PhysicalSubstances are categorized by the main consitutent. 
  Therefore 'SeaWater' is considered as a subtype of 'Water'.  The pure chemical substances
  can be represented when desirable by creating a 'Pure' category under the general heading.
  Thus we have a Type called 'PureWater'.  Steel might be considered as a subtype of 'Iron',
  except that some steels do not have iron as the main consitutent.
  
  COSMO note:  Because substances are represented in COSMO as Types (classes) rather than
  instances, the specification of properties of substances gets involved,
  and the intended meanings cannot be specified fully without the use of FOL.
  As placeholders, some relations between substances are specified, and in OWL these
  will be interprted as applying only to those specific Substances (Type that are
  instances of SubstanceType), while the intended meaning is that the relation
  applies not only to the particular Type but to all subtypes as well.
  THe translation of the OWL ontology to FOL should carefully handle these 
  placeholder relations to be sure hey are translated properly.
  .
  The restriction on hasGrainDiameter for SubstanceTypes (which see) should require 
  subclasses rather than instances
  of LengthMeasure - instances may have to be created as a workaround.
  (still not decided, v0.43).
  
  NOTE that a substance at some particular concentration is a subtype of that
  substance.  To expresss that an object contains a particular concentration of
  a substance, one can create a subclass of that substance having the 
  appropriate concentration attribute, and relate the object to that
  concentration of substance by the relation 'hasConstituentSubstance'.
  
  This representation solves some logical problems, but creates implementation
  problems in restricted logics such as OWL.
  We are using a relation: 'hasQualitativeAttribute', with specific substances
  as the domain 'instance', with a restriction on the range value,
  to indicate that substances necessarily have some particular property.
  However, OWL will interpret the restriction as applying to the instances of the 
  substance Type (of which there are none) rather than on the substance Type itself,
  or its subtype.  This restriction will have to be
  interpreted by applications as meaning that the substance represented by the
  class has those properties.  the easy way to solve the problem is to create 
  a metatype for each substance Type (i.e. for each of millions of substances),
  and have the restriction apply to the metatype - but this duplicates Types
  as metatypes.  Leave the proper implementation to the application</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="ExistingStuffType">
        <rdfs:comment>A collection of collections, and a specialization
            of #$TemporalStuffType.  Each instance of
            #$ExistingStuffType is a collection of things (including
            portions of things) which are both temporally and spatially
            stufflike.  Division in time or space does not destroy the
            stufflike quality of the object (down to a certain
            granularity).    (#$isa STUFFTYPE #$ExistingStuffType)
            implies both (i) for most instances STUFF of STUFFTYPE, for
            any proper physical part (see #$physicalParts) PART of
            STUFF, PART is also an instance of STUFFTYPE and (ii) for
            all instances STUFF of STUFFTYPE, for most proper physical
            parts PART of STUFF, PART is also an instance of STUFFTYPE.
            For example, every piece of wood is temporally stufflike: if
            W-168 is a piece of wood during 1996, then it's also a
            piece of wood for the one-minute time-slice 9:05am 7/7/96.
            It's also spatially stufflike: if we take that piece of
            wood W-168 and cut it in half, we have two things which are
            both pieces of wood.  Since every piece of wood is both
            temporally and spatially stufflike, #$Wood is an instance of
            #$ExistingStuffType.  Other instances of #$ExistingStuffType

            Certain types of people may qualify as 'Resource' - employees,

            Important NOTE: A Resource does not necessarily have to 
            have a net positive value, it merely needs to be useful in 
            some situation.  Some things that may count as
            resources may be, depending on the situation, a

    to the action(s) that it is intended to perform, or can help perform.
    This relation answers the questions 'what is it good for?' or

    *****************  CAUTION *********************************
    **NOTE** This relation points to an ActionType or EventType.  There
    are instances of ActionType that are subtypes of Action, but also there
    are Types that are subtypes of 'DesignFunction' which are also instances
    of ActionType, but these latter types are **note** subtypes of Event, rather
    subtypes of 'AttributeType'.  This is a very unusual use of a
    relation to point to arguments of very different inherent type.
    
    The 'Functions' that are pointed to by this relation may in turn
    be related to actual instances of Event by the relation
    'wasRealizedByAction' (which see),  There is thus a triangular relation
    between Functional objects, the Functional capabilities (attributes) they
    have, and the actual Actions that may be carried out or assisted by 
    those Objects.  These relations 
    
    Permitting the ontologist to point either directly to Actions,
    or to Attributes that point to actions, provides some flexibility.
    it should be underestood and used with care.
    
    *****************  CAUTION *********************************
    
    
    Many artifacts will be related to actions by both relations.  If not for 
    caveat (2), 'hasDesignFunction' would be a subrelation of
    'enablesOrAssists'. Another difference is that the design function of 
    artifacts will in general be more specific than the actions
    enabled by resources.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:Class rdf:ID="InheritableType">
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class"/>
    <rdfs:comment>InheritableType is a specialization of the Protege owl:Class which
    is used to identify those metatypes which, when specified as the
    parent Type for some class (Type) in the ontology, will also
    by implication be the parent Type for all subtypes of any Type
    explicitly designated as an instance of any subtype of 'InheritableType'.
    This is a primitive mechanism to permit translation of this ontology
    among various formats, while permitting the use of reasoning engines
    which require that arguments to relations, if restricted
    as to Type, be instances of some specified Type.
    
    There are some ontologies, such as SUMO, using first-order
    logic, which permit one to specify that an argument to a relation
    must be a *subtype* of some Type in the ontology, rather than an
    *instance* of some Type.  OWL and some other reasoning engines do
    not permit that kind of restriction.  For convenience, to allow 
    this ontology to be used in multiple reasoning engines and to
    be automatically translated into multiple formats, this metatype is provided
    and so that one can avoid having to specify the metatype instance of
    every Type that is to be used as an argument to a relation.
    When using this ontology in an inference engine that requires
    explicit types, it will be necessary to add the InheritableType
    as a Type of each subtype of any Type that is specified 
    to be an instance of such an inheritable type.  That addition
    will have to be one in a preprocessing stage before using that
    inference engine.
    
    An axiom may be added to an ontology using FOL to specify that
    all subtypes of a Type ?T that is an instance of an InheritableType ?MT
    will also be instances of that InheritableType:
    
    (=>
       (and
          (isanInstanceOf ?T ?MT)
          (isaSubclassOf ?MT InheritableType))
       (forall (?ST)
          (=>
             (isaSubclassOf ?ST ?T)
             (isanInstanceOf ?ST ?MT))))
             
    This axiom will permit the ontologist to avoid specifying the 
    metatype for every subtype of the root type of that Type tree,
    in those ontology implementations that can use FOL.</rdfs:comment>

        a very broad concept, including participation in actions and passive processes.
        In general, it is not necessary or desirable to list all the roles that
        an object may play, as in many cases those roles may be very numerous.
        This 'attribute' would be used rather to indicate the more salient roles that
        an object can play.  For example, a Person who has a particular talent
        or skill could have that skill specified; a company that can make a particular
        product would have that capability.  Another important 'Capability'
        is categorized under the subtype 'Tendency', which specifies the way
        that an object is likely to behave; the tendency of non-living organic
        material to decompose when not frozen is an example of such a tendency.
        See 'Tendency' for additional discussion of that subtype.

      To dissect individual capabilities, it is necessary to create instances of
       the subtypes of this Type (InstrumentCapability or AgentCapability),
       and each of those instances should specify exactly what type of
       Action the role (Agent or Instrument) is effective in.

      Each subtype of Capability is a role in some type of action that some
       Object can perform or assist in performing.  One subtype of this
       is 'Function', specifically a type of action for which an object
       has been designed, either by some IntelligentAgent or by Evolution.

      Capbilities generally have more than one degree - as in 'Intelligence'.

      In CYC, classes representing types of capability are signaled by
        making them instances of a metaclass of 'capabilities'.  COSMO
        avoids metaclasses except where necessary to serve as the type restriction
        on a relation's argument.  Thus 'CapabilityType' is defined for
        that purpose.
        
      To squeeze this notion into an OWL binary relation format,
        specialized relations are used:
           canServeAsAgentInActionType
           canServeAsInstrumentInActionType
        . . . but the logical relations between these relations and 
        the attibution of a Capability to some Object or Agent must
        depend on rules not definable in a simple OWL format.
        Extensions may use SWRL for this.
    
      The relation between a 'Capability' and the actual instance of
         physical action is 'wasRealizedByAction'.
         
      @ToDo: more elaboration needed (v0.45). Higher-arity relations
      would be useful here:
          {{?x hasCapability ?y} impliesThat
           {?x canPerformRole ?ROLE inEventType ?EVENTTYPE}}
       NOTE the triangular relation:
       an Artifact hasDesignFunction which is
       an ActionType, A Capability or Function wasRealizedByAction which is an
       *instance* of an Event or Action Type.

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Difference">
    <rdfs:comment>A Difference is an AttributeValue of a pair of entities,
      or of the diachronically same entity at different times.  The AttributeValue
      consists of a group of paired AttributeValues, one pair for each type
      of AttributeValue or Relation for which the value differs.  If there
      are no attribute values or relations that differ, the two
      entities might be identical - but if they have different locations,
      they will not be identical even if the locations are not specified
      in the description of the entities.  The problem in deciding identity from
      a list of differences is that one never knows that *all* properties of two 
      entities are known to be compared.  Quantum mechanical issues
      create additional complications in comparisons at the subatomic level.
      
      A difference is one or more pairs of Attributes, qualitative or 
      quantitative, that is derived as the result of a comparison process between
      one or more attributes of two entities, or between that attribute of a single
      entity after some period of time, as after an Event.   A comparison process
      may also result in a partially complementary list of similarities (see 'Similarity').
     
     There is no exact WordNet concept that expressses this meaning, but this is
     closest to WordNet sense 1 of 'difference:
       WN: the quality of being unlike or dissimilar;
        'there are many differences between jazz and rock'
     WN-N04692996: sense 1 of 'difference' in WN 2.1.
     
     In the case of wordnet sense 1, it appears that this is intended to
       represent an overall difference, which could be a set of differences
       between two entities.There is, however, no other sense of 'difference'
       in WordNet that is more general, so this sense is assigned the 
       most general 'difference'
     
     A common-sense problem arises when we classify a difference as
     merely an attribute which expresses the result of 'subtracting' one 
     attribute value from another.  If there is no difference, this
     result constitutes both a difference (value = 0) and a
     similarity (i.e. no difference).  This is counterintuitive, from a
     linguistic point of view.  Accordingly, though logically a 'similarity' 
     could be classified as merely a 'small difference', the term
     'similarity' will not be arranged as a subtype of 'Difference', but directly
     under 'AttributeValue', as is 'Difference'.
     
     To 'compare and contrast' two entities, both the similarities 
     and the differences might be listed.</rdfs:comment>

      or negligibly small.  (see also 'Difference' for a related 
      concept).
      
      The common-sense notion of 'similarity' implies that the 
      things that are 'similar' are not in fact the same thing.
      When asked to describe similarities, the list should include
      those properties (attributes or relations) that are little
      different between nonidentical entities.  There may also be
      many ifferences, but the differences
      are not part of the 'similarity' attribute.</rdfs:comment>

      imply that the Action caused was mediated by causation of a MentalEvent.
      
      The difference between MentalCausation and PhysicalCausation is that the former
      must act through the intermediation of some MentalEvent in an agent, whereas the
      latter procedes directly by transfer of matter or energy to some physical system,
      and does not require the intermediation of some mental action in a cognitive agent.
      Mental causation is a subrelations of physical causation, since it proceeds via
      a physical Event, and causes a MentalEvent, which is a subtype of physical event.
      
      NOTE that the desire for or anticipation of some future event can be a mental cause.
      Thus, although a mental cause (such as desire or anticipation) must predede or be 
      simultaneous with its effect, just as for physical causes, a FutureEvent may be directly
      related to a mental cause (form a part of the anticipated or desired event), which is not true 
      of physical causes.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>hadMentalEffect is a subproperty of 'hasEffect' in which the Effect
      is a MentalEvent or mental process.  It is also a subproperty of 
      'isTheCauseOfMentalSituation', which is a relation with a
      borader range of causative things. 
      
      NOTE that this is an instance-level relation, and cannot be used
      to state that some type of Event typically or always causes some
      type of mental effect.  For the type-level relation use 'causesMentalEvent'.
      
      NOTE that the use of the past tense in this relation does not necessarily
      mean that the Event argument occurred in the past before the assertion time;
      this relation can also be used to relate possible future Events.
      The past tense merely emphasizes that we are discussing arg1 Events
      that, in the given context, are viewed as completed and not ongoing.
      
      NOTE that although this relation specifies causation of a mental Event
       or process, the resulting Event may be the impetus to an Action 
       that was motivated by a MentalEvent caused by
       the first argument Event.  Thus external Events that cause mental
       states may cause physical Events via this relation of mental 
       causation.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="convincedAgentToAction">
    <rdfs:comment>convincedAgentToAction is a subproperty of 'hadMentalEffect' in which
       the Effect is a MentalEvent, or some Action resulting from a MentalEvent
       that was caused by the first argument.  This is an aggregate relation, which should 
       be a tertiary relation of the form {?Event convinced ?Agent toDo ?Action}.
       Because of the binary relation limitation of OWL, this is compressed into
       a binary relation in which the second argument is an Action that specifies
       a specific Action performed by some specific Agent.  To determine the Agent that
       was convinced by the Event of argument1, it will be necessary to extract the
       Agent from the Action instance.  This relation expresses the notion of 
       something (a physical Event or some social Event such as a discussion) 
       convincing someone to think something, believe something, to feel some
       emotion, or to do some action.
      
      NOTE that although this relation name indicates 'Action', the 'Action' can
      be a strictly mental event (even a stative Event) such as believing something
      or having some emotional reaction such as fear or eager anticipation.
      This relation can be used to epress the results of some action taken by one
      person or organization to persuade someone else to believe something.  The causative 
      Event, however, need not be a deliberate attempt at persuasion; some natural event can persuade 
      people to believe something or to take action, and this relation can be broadly
      utilized to express, for example, that some astronomical event convinced a scientist that
      some physical law is true; or that some natural disaster convinced people to move their
      residence.
            
      NOTE that this is an instance-level relation, and cannot be used

              have a general chemical specification, that is, whose
              instances do not have exactly the same chemical composition
              but fall within certain specifications, e.g., #$DNAStuff.
              Note that collections that are _not_ instances of
              #$ChemicalSubstanceType include collections of substances
              which have some component which is of overriding
              significance in some context, so that in everyday language
              such substances are frequently referred to by the name of
              their important component (e.g.,  penicillin  applied to a
              tablet containing penicillin), but which have significant
              admixtures of other substances. Thus, #$Penicillin is an
              instance of #$ChemicalSubstanceType, but the collection of
              tablets containing penicillin and including other
              ingredients is not.  Also, specializations of #$Mixture,
              such as #$Lemonade, are _not_ instances of
              #$ChemicalSubstanceType, because mixtures are determined by
              their physical state rather than solely by their chemical composition.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: a Product is something of a kind that
     is or was usually created with the intention that it be sold in exchange
     for money or some other valuable thing.  It may be a physical object 
     (or substance), a service, or a right.  A stock option, for example,is
     categorized as a right rather than an object or service, but is
     created as a 'Product' for sale.
    
     Because things created commercially may also be created by individuals
     for their own use, being a Product does not necessarily mean
     that each individual instance was in fact created with the intention 
     to be sold.  Creation for sale means that things of this Type will
     usually be found on the market, or was mostly found on the market
     at one time.  Antique objects  will still be Products even after that
     kind of object is no longer manufactured.

     or light, or both (as in a fireplace); the heat in turn can be 
     converted into other forms of energy.

     This Type includes the Cyc: 'CombustibleFuelSubstance'. 

     NOTE this 'Fuel' is for combustion.  Nuclear 'Fuel' is of
     a different Type.
     
     COSMO note: Fuel is considered an ArtificialSubstance because any
     material must be processed by people before it is 
     considered as Fuel.  Trees in their natural state, though
     combustible, are not Fuel - until they have been cut and gathered
     into a form that can be conveniently burned, in which case
     the processed wood is then Fuel.  Likewise,

    Any amount of salt, up to a maximum solubility limit, can be dissolved in a given 
    amount of water to form a Solution.
    
    NOTE: ToDo: the restrictions do not capture the proper semantics, and need

    be a liquid that has the Role of Solvent in this solution.

   Cyc comment (modified): An instance of #$ExistingStuffType, and a specialization of #$Mixture.
            Each instance of #$Solution is a mixture of two or more chemically
            distinct substances, the Solvent (a liquid) and the Solute.
            Instances of #$Solution are homogeneous, meaning that the
            composition at any one point in a given instance is the same
            as that at any other point (for 'points' having a volume
            larger than the grain size).  In contrast, instances of
            #$Suspension are mixtures in which small discontinuous
            solid particles are surrounded by a continuous fluid.  The
            #$solvent of every #$Solution has the #$stateOfMatter
            #$Liquid-StateOfMatter.  Thus #$Solutions also normally
            exhibit the properties of a liquid, since #$solvents are
            #$mainConstituents.   Examples of #$Solutions include a
            sample of seawater, a cup of coffee, a tincture of iodine,
            some vanilla extract.  In some rare cases a Solute may have 
            a higher weight percentage of the Solute than the Solvent.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#TemporalThing"/>
    <rdfs:comment>Role is a high-level concept that aggregates several primitive notions, 
     and is difficult to describe analytically, but has a necessary property that,
     as a subtype of TemporalThing; every instance has a beginning time and an
     ending time.  For Roles that are created by an Event and last forever,
     (The Father of PrinceWilliam), the ending time can be TheEndOfTime.  For case roles
     in a specific Event, the Role lasts no longer than the duration of the Event (but
     may last for less than that time, for participants who participate only
     for part of an Event).  The most common
     use of 'Role' is for concepts that exist in dependence on other concepts, such as 
     'mother', which implies a child, or 'President' which implies some organization.
     But grammatical roles such as the cases of verb case frames will also fit 
     under this broad category.  When a phrase such as 'The ?X of ?Y' is encountered,
     almost invariably the ?X is a Role of some kind, which also includes parts.

     NOTE importantly: that HumanRole is a subtype of this category, and also a subtype 
     of Person, so Person and Role are not disjoint.  This allows HumanRoles 
     (janitor, President) to serve in the same relations that people themselves would serve,
     but they are also recognizable as Roles because they will be subtypes of the Role
     catgegory.
     
     NOTE also that when used as a pure OWL ontology, it will be necessary for
     every subclass of Role should to be an instance of RoleType, so that it can be 
     used as an argument for the relation 'isServingInTheRoleOf'.  If, in other formats,
     this condition is not explicit, the translation should add the Type when 
     converting into OWL format.
     
     For Roles that are merged with other Types, such as HumanRoles, each should
     have its own explicit relation indicating when the role-filler started in that
     role and when (it/he/she) ended.  If it is possible to fill a Role for
     multiple non-continguous periods of time, then that begin and end time relation
     cannot be functional.
     
     NOTE also that the use of 'Role" in the COSMO is still being developed, and
      is likely to be seen to be inconsistent in application (though not logically
      inconsistent) as of v 0.43.  The issue not yet resolved is whether the 
      subtypes of 'Role' as here used would be better categorized as 'playing a role'
      rather than 'being a role'.  Although this quasi-philosophical issue is not
      yet clear, this vagueness does not appear to cause any logical inconsistencies
      in usage.</rdfs:comment>

      each grammatical Type also has some semantic content; the semantic
      content becomes more precise as the subtypes of the CaseRole
      become more detailed.

        Cyc:  A specialization of #$hasWorkers (q.v.) that
            relates employers to their  paid employees.  (#$employees
            EMPLOYER; WORKER;) means
            WORKER; regularly  performs work for
            EMPLOYER;, and EMPLOYER;
            pays WORKER; for that work (often  by
            paycheck).  EMPLOYER; directs the manner

            might provide the workplace, tools, materials, capital, or
            other  assistance for the work.  EMPLOYER;

        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of #$AtLeastPartiallyMentalEvent.
            Each instance of this collection is an event which is
            'strictly mental' in the sense that if the event
            is instantiated by some physical situation, that
            instantiating situation is not essential to the event being
            an event of that type.  For instance, perceiving an apple is
            not an instance of #$StrictlyMentalEvent insofar as it
            essentially requires sense organs and an apple (and thus
            #$Perceiving is not a specialization of
            #$StrictlyMentalEvent). However, the phenomenological
            aspects of this event, e.g., the experience of redness or
            roundness, do not require the sense organs or the apple, and
            it is conceivable that a disembodied mind could have such
            experiences. (Thus, #$ExperiencingPerception is a
            specialization of #$StrictlyMentalEvent.)   Note that the
            property defining this collection is primitive and
            notoriously difficult to define, except via examples. If an
            event is not clearly an instance of
            #$ExperiencingPerception, entertaining a thought
            (#$Thinking), or #$ExperiencingEmotion, or fully
            decomposable into a collection of such events, then one
            should be very careful about making it in an instance of #$StrictlyMentalEvent.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: In Cyc a feeling is called 'FeelingAttribute' and
         classified very differently, though the intended meaning is the
         same.  In COSMO, feelings and emotions are considered as
         PersistentStates - events in which some more or less constant
         mental process that does not involve symbolic thinking is going on.
         Feelings are vague and only can be labeled in very general terms.
         All different types of feeling are primitive concepts.  feelings include
         emotions, worries, concerns, elation, many others.
          
          Cyc: The collection of all emotions and mental
            feelings.  As an emotion/feeling can be experienced in
            various degrees of intensity, an instance of
            #$FeelingAttribute is some particular  relative amount  of
            happiness, confidence, fear, or whatever.  These  relative
            amounts  can be measured using the #$GenericValueFunctions
            (q.v.), such as #$LowAmountFn, #$VeryHighAmountFn, etc.  For
            example, (#$LowAmountFn #$Happiness) is the
            #$FeelingAttribute of feeling a relatively low amount of
            happiness.  (Note that #$Happiness itself is not an
            individual feeling attribute but a _collection_ of
            #$FeelingAttributes -- a #$FeelingType (q.v.) -- whose
            instances are the individual attributes of feeling
            particular relative amounts of happiness; (#$LowAmountFn

        <rdfs:comment>The enjoyment of pleasurable satisfaction that
            goes with well-being, security, effective accomplishments,

            #$Collection -- the collection of all possible amounts of
            happiness one can feel.  One instance of #$Happiness is
            `extremely happy&apos;; another is `just a little bit
            happy&apos;.    Note:  Obviously there are no real units of
            measure for this quantity, ways of objectively measuring the
            amount of happiness possessed or gained or lost, etc., but
            still this has proven to be a useful way for Cyc to
            represent and reason with emotions.  E.g., one can have a
            rule that says that most people have a greater `amount&apos;
            of happiness at their wedding than at their high school
            graduation, etc.  There are functions, such as
            #$LowAmountFn, which take a #$PrimitiveScalarIntervalType
            (such as the instances of #$FeelingType) such as #$Happiness
            and return as their value a certain-sized amount of that
            feeling; e.g., (#$LowAmountFn #$Happiness) is an expression
            whose value is a positive but small amount of happiness, and
            that in turn will be an instance of #$Happiness (and also
            will be an instance of #$FeelingAttribute).  #$FeelingTypes
            organize into a lattice; e.g., there are several more
            specialized forms of #$Happiness that are present in
            Cyc&apos;s ontology, such as #$Elation, #$Delight,
            #$Triumph-TheFeeling, etc.</rdfs:comment>

            COSMO note: A feeling does not have to be totally preoccupying to 
            be a 'Concern'.  A person may have many concerns at one time.

            future bad event.  Linguistically that future event
            would be the ?X in the phrase {J is concerned about ?X}

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="ProblemSituation">
        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Event"/>
        <rdfs:comment>A ProblemSituation is an Event (which may be a StaticSituation)
          that is a cause for Concern to some CognitiveAgent (usually a Person).
          Animals are not excluded from agents that might have a Concern,
          so animals may have ProblemSituations (e.g. a mother cat looking for
          a lost kitten).
          
          The restriction requires, for each instance of 'Problem' a 
          specification of the instance of 'DirectedFeeling' (fear, concern)
          that is caused by the Problem, i.e. what kind of Problem it is
          perceived to be by someone.  The instance of DirectedFeeling
          will contain within it a specification of the Agent to
          whom it is a Problem.  It also requires specification of an
          instance of a 'ProblemToBeSolved', which is an AbstractString
          representing a LogicalAssertion citing the existence of the ProblemSituation
          (in some World, real or hypothetical), and its logical description.
          The logical description
          portion of the ProblemToBeSolved may be symbolically identical to the
          representation of the 'ProblemSituation' itself, if the logical 
          language used is the same as that of the ontology.  In that case, to
          avoid duplicationm the 'ProblemToBeSolved' and 'ProblemSituation'
          may cross-reference each other.  But the differnce between a 
          logical representation of a problem in a ProblemToBeSolved and
          its representation in a ProblemSituation is that the ProblemToBeSolved
          form is interpreted as a String, which in effect is only a rerpresentation
          of the ProblemSituation, wheras the instance of ProblemSituation
          is interpreted as the situation itself.
          
          NOTE:  this method of specifying Problem does not allow us
          to call a situation a 'Problem' unless the Agent for whom
          it is a Problem is aware of and concerned about it.
          We may need another kind of objective 'problem' that *would be*
          of concern to an agent, if that agent knew about it and understood
          it.  As of version 0.46, that kind of 'problem' is not
          represented in COSMO.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="IntentionalMentalSituation">
        <rdfs:comment>A collection of mental states and events whose
            instances are characterized by intentionality: they  are  of
            or  about  some thing external to themselves. Thoughts, acts
            of perception, and propositional attitudes are three common
            types of intentional mental situations.  Thus, a particular
            act of thinking about the Eiffel Tower, an event  of seeing
            the Eiffel Tower, and a given subject's believing  that
            the Eiffel Tower is in Paris are three intentional mental
            situations, all having (at least) the Eiffel Tower as their
            object.   Any thing whatsoever can in principle be the
            object of an  intentional mental situation: I can think
            about a given physical  object, an event, a relation, an
            attribute, a proposition, a  mental state (my own or
            another's), a set, a collection, or  anything else.
            (Note that the above mentioned belief about the  Eiffel
            Tower and Paris is arguably not itself about the
            _proposition_ that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris.  But now
            note  that my belief in the content of the sentence
            preceding this  one clearly _is_, in part, about that
            proposition.)  Mental  situations that are _not_
            intentional, and thus not in this  collection, include
            moods, itches, and pain experiences.  Note  that, although
            they are indirectly related (see e.g.
            #$PurposefulMentalActivity), the sense of  intentional
            described above is not to be confused with its other sense
            as  an antonym of  accidental .  See also

        <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#ObjectProperty"/>
        <rdfs:comment>isaTemporalPartOf relates one Event
          to another Event of which the subject Event is a part.
          This is a relation on instances, not types of events,
          so the part of a particular oath-taking event when 
          the oath-taker raises her hand may be a temporal part of
          the oath-taking event.  The part must be a proper part
          of the larger event.
          
          This is somewhat similar to the 'subprocess' relation
          of SUMO:
          SUMO (subprocess) (subProcess ?SUBPROC ?PROC) means
          that ?SUBPROC is a subprocess of ?PROC.  A subprocess
          is here understood as a temporally distinguished part
          (proper or not) of a Process.

          **NOTE**  that a temporal part includes **every** part of
          an event that occurs diring some specific time interval,
          not just the changes in some selected fluents that take
          place in a time interval.  So if the larger Event has
          multiple fluents represented, the changes in all of those fluents
          taht take place in some time interval during an Event must be 
          represented in the Event pointed to as the subject of
          the 'isaTemporalpartOf' relation.
          
          **IF** one wants to refer to the changes in a single fluent
          during some part of a larger Event in which multiple fluents
          are represented, then use the 'hasSubevent' relation.</rdfs:comment>

          logical treatment of Events in COSMO does not
          attempt to follow Vendler.  The characeristic of

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="IntrinsicStateChangeEvent">
        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of #$Event-Localized. Each
            instance of #$IntrinsicStateChangeEvent is an event
            characterized primarily by a change in some intrinsic
            property of at least one main actor involved in the event.
            Such intrinsic changes may include changes of a thing's
            color, temperature, device state, or size.  Events where the
            main change is extrinsic (such as a change in location or
            ownership) are not instances of #$IntrinsicStateChangeEvent.
            In events which have more than one actor, the event may be
            an #$IntrinsicStateChangeEvent for one actor but not for
            another.  For example, in a #$FasteningSafetyBelt event, the
            #$SafetySeatBelt (the device used) goes from unconnected to
            connected (to itself), which is an intrinsic change;
            however, the agent who does the fastening does not change
            intrinsically, but only in his configuration to the belt, an
            external object.  Another example: in a #$HairCuttingEvent,
            the hair that is cut undergoes an
            #$IntrinsicStateChangeEvent due to its role in that kind of
            event, but the barber undergoes no intrinsic change due to
            the hair cutting.    Note that some events, such as an ice
            cube melting into a small puddle of water, could be
            represented either as an #$IntrinsicStateChangeEvent or as a
            #$PhysicalTransformationEvent, but not (within a single
            micro-theory) as both.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of Event specific to Cyc:

          Cyc:  A specialization of #$PhysicalEvent whose
            instances include translational or rotational movements of
            whole objects (see #$MovementEvent), objects changing shape
            (see #$ShapeChangeEvent), as well as events in which salient
            parts of an object move or change shape in relation to the
            reference frame of the whole object.  For example, although
            a ticking grandfather clock is not normally undergoing
            either a #$MovementEvent or a #$ShapeChangeEvent, it can
            still be said to be moving - and thus undergoing a
            #$MovementOrShapeChangeEvent - in virtue of the fact that a
            salient part of the clock, the pendulum, is swinging.  (Of
            course, the pendulum itself is periodically undergoing
            #$Movement-Rotation, and the tip of the pendulum is
            undergoing a #$Movement-TranslationEvent.)  As a negative
            example, a catatonic person should not be thought of as
            undergoing any #$MovementOrShapeChangeEvent.  Although blood
            moves through such a person's veins, her lungs expand
            and contract, and so on, these things would not normally be
            considered salient enough to entail that the person herself
            was undergoing a movement or shape change event.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of both #$Conveyance and
            #$PhysicalDevice.  Each instance of #$TransportationDevice
            is an artifact designed to move an object from one location
            to another, by (for example) carrying, pulling, or pushing
            the transported object.  Instances of this collection may or
            may not have their own power source (see
            #$SelfPoweredDevice).  Those that do, such as automobiles
            and speedboats, constitute the specialization
            #$TransportationDevice-Vehicle.  Other transportation
            devices (for example, instances of #$Wheelbarrow or
            #$Bicycle) require an external motive force.  Because
            #$transporter and #$transportees are specializations of
            #$objectMoving, it follows that any object in the role of
            #$transporter moves as a whole with those objects playing
            the role of #$transportees.  Consequently, since any
            instance of #$TransportationDevice has playing the role of
            #$transporter as its intended function, stationary objects
            which cause motion, such as conveyor belts, escalators,
            rocket launchers, and slingshots, are excluded from the
            collection #$TransportationDevice. Although they facilitate
            travel, ice skates, shoes, skis and other instances of
            #$WearableConveyance are also excluded from the collection
            #$TransportationDevice, since they are devices which are
            worn rather than ridden on, ridden with, or ridden in.

            SUMO: A TransportationDevice is a Device which serves as the
            instrument in a Transportation Process which carries 
            the patient of the Process from one point to another.
            
            COSMO note: In SUMO, an Oar was a subtype of TransportationDevice,
            but in COSMO that was not adopted.  COSMO adopts the
            Cyc usage that a TransportationDEvice must be ridden in,
            ridden on, or ridden with.  An Oar is an accessory part of
            a boat, not a TransportationDevice in itself.
            
            A TransportationDevice should have an unambiguous front
            and back - the front is the direction in which
            the transportation device typically moves.  For
            devices that can move in either direction with
            equal facility, the 'front' may be designated arbitrarily,
            by some distinctive criterion.
            This provides a reference direction with which an 'orientation' 
            can be described.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="Path-Physical">
        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note:  In Cyc a 'Path-Customary'.
           A Path-Customary is reinterpreted as 'Path-Physical' in
        COSMO, being a linear arrangement of physical material that permits or
        assists something to 'move' in some sense along the path.  It is
        therefore a physical object, and certain types of communications
        'channels' such as a point-to-point radio link, do not 
        qualify. because the 'path' involved (the 'ether') does not assist
        the movement of the signal.
        
        At this point we have not formalized the notion that it is
        easier (takes less effort) for objects to move along a path
        than to move where that kind of path does not exist.
        
        Note that we add a restriction specifying that every instance
        of path must have some instance of PhysicalObject that can
        move along it.  This existential should not be too burdensome,
        since we can generally mention some individual physical object
        that *can* move (not necessarily does move)  along every path tht is
        instantiated.
        
        Cyc:  A specialization of #$Path-Spatial.  Each instance
            of #$Path-Customary is a spatial path which was either
            designed as a path by some intelligent agent, or which has a
            significant known function as a path for movement.  Examples
            include roads, railroads, sea-lanes, cowpaths, boardwalks,
            tubes, channels, blood vessels, fibers, wires, and
            communication links. An instance of #$Path-Customary may be
            either an instance of #$Path-Simple (in which case it would
            be a path with two distinct ends, not forming a cycle) or an
            instance of #$Path-Cyclic.</rdfs:comment>

            considered 'Front' and the  other side is
            considered 'Back'.  Usually the two sides in

            necessarily imply a bottom and  top, or a left and right: a
            #$Worm has a clear-cut front end and a  clear-cut back end

            not change what counts as the 'front' and what

            intrinsic #$TopSide and an intrinsic #$BottomSide.  By
            'intrinsic' we mean simply that there exists an
            established convention according to which one side is
            considered 'top' and the other side is considered
            'bottom'.  Usually the two sides in question can
            be reliably distinguished from one another.  For example, by
            convention, the 'top' of a
            #$Table-PieceOfFurniture is the side on which other objects
            usually rest, while the 'bottom' is the side which
            usually touches the floor.  Notice that a conventionally
            distinguishable bottom and top do not necessarily imply a
            left and right, or a front and back.  A plant is a good
            example of the case where they do not: top and bottom can be
            reliably distinguished but not, ordinarily, front and back
            or left and right.  Notice also--and this is crucial to the
            whole conception--that while a #$TopAndBottomSidedObject may
            well have a preferred orientation, changing this orientation
            does not change what counts as 'top' and what
            counts as 'bottom': if a car flips over on the
            highway its top is now facing the pavement and its
            bottom--the undercarriage--is now up in the air.  If an
            entity does not obey this rule then it does not, generally
            speaking, count as having a distinguishable top and
            bottom--example: an hourglass or a book.  (see also

        <rdfs:comment>A #$LeftAndRightSidedObject is an object with an
            intrinsic left side and an intrinsic right side.  By
            'intrinsic' we mean simply that there exists an

            considered 'Left' and the other side is considered
            'Right'.  Usually, the two sides can be reliably

            conventionally distinguishable left and right do not
            necessarily imply a bottom and top, or a front and back.
            Interestingly, it has proved impossible so far to find
            instances of objects with a left and right but no top,
            bottom, front or back.  It is unclear why this should be so,
            but it apparently pertains to human psychology in reasoning
            about directions. However, if an object has a conventionally
            distinguished top, bottom, front, and back, then these
            suffice to determine an intrinsic left and an intrinsic
            right.  Notice also--and this is crucial to the whole
            conception--that while a #$LeftAndRightSidedObject may well
            have a preferred orientation, changing this orientation does
            not change what counts as 'left' and what counts
            as 'right': if you turn me upside down my left
            side does not become my right side and my right side my
            left. If an entity does not obey this rule then it does not,
            generally speaking, count as having a distinguishable left
            and right--example: a houseplant.</rdfs:comment>

    >servesAsaPathFor relates a Path-Physical to some physical object that can move
    more easily along that path than if the path were absent.  This
    relation can answer the question 'what moves along this path?'
    Note that we can have paths for electricity and light waves (optical
    fibers), because electrons and photons are considered as physical objects
    in the COSMO ontology.
    
    COSMO-TODO:  This is a relation that should be defined on types, i.e. 
    a particular type of path typically serves for a particular type of object
    (that can move along it).  To avoid excessive use of metaclasses, at
    this point (v0.2) this relation is used as a relation on instances,
    and used in restrictions, which do
    not express precisely what is intended.  A general metatype

    <rdfs:comment>A Structure is a solid Artifact, either a ConstructionArtifact,
    which is intended to be used when stationary, or a mobile artifact designed
    to be large enough for people to stand up inside it while performing
    activities.  This means that large ships, mobile homes, and spacecraft would be
    'Structures', and a transmission tower that cannot contain people but
    is intended to function when stationary is also a 'Structure'  
       A Structure does not have to be a whole object; part of a building would also
     be a Structure, but it should be able to acommodate people standing, and
     have some separate identity (such as a room).
    .  Also, the Structure does not have to be enclosed,
    so an outdoor recreation facility which is useful primarily because of the
    constructed artifacts it contains (e.g. a high school ball field) will
    also qualify - but a park that
    is enjoyable primarily because of the natural vegetation would not
    qualify.  Because of the ambiguity, the most useful categories
    are likely to be the subtypes.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="FixedStructure">
        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note:  As an Artifact, the classification of 
        'FixedStructure' depends on what function it was intended to serve,
        and for this category a FixedStructure is built with the intention that
        it will perform its functions while fastened (at least by gravity) to some
        specific location on or near the surface of an astronomical body,
        in almost all cases of course, that will be the surface of the Earth.
        
        A marginal Type which is not a fixed structure is a MobileHome, i,e,
          a living unit on wheels.  A MobileHome may stop and be connected
          to services at a trailer park, but unless taken off the wheels and
          connected to a foundation will still not be a FixedStructure.
          However, a modular home, which is movable but designed to be
          transported to a location and placed on a foundation, to be used 
          there, will be a FixedStructure.  Buildings that were built with the
          intention of staying in one location may at some time be moved to
          a different location by building movers (while retaining their 
          identity), and they will still be FixedStructures, even after
          having been moved.  The immobility of a FixedStructure is not an
          absolute requirement, but a probability statement.
          
          The intuition that is captured by this category is the logical
          assertion that, if a FixedStructure is in some geographical 
          location at time T, it will, with greater than 99% probability,
          be in the same location at time T plus one month (the exact probabilities
          will vary with the actual subcategory, and will be discovered 
          over time by experience.).

            topographical regions like mountains and underwater spaces,
            places defined by demographics (e.g., language areas) and
            territory otherwise demarcated (e.g. #$TimeZones).  In

            #$DualistGeopoliticalMt], instances of #$GeopoliticalEntity
            are also considered to be instances of #$GeographicalRegion.
            In all cases the region in question must contain some
            tangible component with which it is possible to make
            physical contact.  The instances of #$GeographicalRegion
            contrast in this respect with the instances of
            #$GeographicalThing-Intangible, which are wholly intangible.
            Examples of #$GeographicalRegion include
            #$RockyMountainStates-USRegion, the #$ContinentOfAustralia,
            #$SinaiPeninsula, and - in  dualist  geopolitical contexts
            - #$YaleUniversity and #$CityOfPittsburghPA.  Some
            important types of regions are represented by the
            sub-collections #$LanguageArea, #$TimeZone,
            #$PostalCodeRegion, #$EcologicalRegion, #$ConstructionSite,
            and - in  dualist  geopolitical contexts --

            function (see #$primaryFunction) is to contain something
            (see #$ContainingSomething).  Note that just about anything
            can serve as a container without actually being a container.
            For example the palm of your hand when cupped may contain
            some marbles.  But because your palm is not always
            configured as and does not function primarily as a

            not  fastened down  and is light enough for an average human
            (or, more to the point, for its average intended user) to
            move easily.  For many instances of #$PortableObject,
            portability is important for the fulfillment of their
            primary functions;  for example, an article of clothing (an
            instance of #$SomethingToWear),  a hand-guided tool (an
            instance of #$HandTool), a coin or dollar bill (an instance

            #$Flashlight) would be pretty useless if they weren't
            portable.  In other cases, making a device portable, or
            making a portable version of a device, simply provides a
            convenience, as with the subcollections #$PortableTelevision
            and #$PortableStereoSystem.  Note that #$Tool is not a
            subcollection of #$PortableObject, since many tools are
            heavy and/or stationary.  A borderline example of a
            #$PortableObject would be a heart/lung machine; although the
            beneficiary of its primary function is in no position to
            move it around, the physicians and nurses who also are
            using  it can and do exactly that.  The same goes for a
            playpen; the kids in it had better _not_ be able to move it
            around, but the adults who set it up and put them there can
            and do move it.   A borderline non-example would be a car;
            even though its user can make it move around, that is more a
            controlling action than a transporting action --- i.e., the
            car is doing the transporting in that case, not the driver.
            A borderline example is a cat; even though it moves under
            its own power, it is light enough for its owner to pick it
            up and move it around.  A borderline example is a bed or a
            dresser; though too heavy to lift, its owners can generally
            move it around (by sliding, disassembling and reassembling,
            and so on).</rdfs:comment>

   SUMO: Roadway is the subclass of LandTransitways that are areas intended for surface travel by self-powered, wheeled vehicles, excluding those that travel on tracks.  Roadways have been at least minimally improved to enable the passage of vehicles. Roadways include dirt and gravelled roads, paved streets, and expressways.

    >A GenericAgent is an aggregate concept representing things that 
    can be linguistically categorized as agents, that is they are the
    causative subject of an action.  The difficulty comes when including
    Organizations as Agents; Organizations are not actual physical Objects, 
    therefore cannot literally do things to change the physical world. Rather,
    people who belong to Organizations, or their 'agents' do the actual moving 
    and lifting that are the causes of actions in the real world.  Nevertheless 
    we talk of organizations as though they were somehow objects that did the
    actions themselves.  This category is here to provide a place for the 
    linguistic notion of 'Agent' that can include 'social agents' such as organizations.

    In this classification we adopt a broad view of agents, allowing inanimate

    <rdfs:comment>An IntentionalAgent is an Agent that (typically) has the capacity
    to form a plan of action.    Therefore an IntentionalAgent is an Agent to whom
    some purpose may be assigned -  even if only the purpose of survival.
    The level of intentionality required to belong to this category is not as high as that
    required to belong to the more specific category of 'IntelligentAgent'.  
    Therefore computer programs that do not approach human-level linguistic capacity,
    but have some level of intentionality (in this ontology 'SoftwareAgents') will fit
    in this category.
  
   This category will also include some non-human animals that can be said to
   be able to form some plans, however primitive.  As of COSMO version 0.3,
   we include only mammals under this class.  If it is shown that other animals can form 
   primitive plans, at that time they may also be added as subtypes of
   this category.
 
   OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
   #$Agent-Generic is the collection of all agents, or things (like #$Animals, #$Robots, #$DivineBeings, etc.) that have desires and intentions and the presumed ability to act on them. An instance of this collection may be an instance of #$AgentiveArtifact or #$Agent (but not both).
   
   In SUMO, 'CognitiveAgent' appears to be the approximate equivalent.
   SUMO:  An Agent that has rights but may or may not have responsibilities and the ability 
   to reason.  If the latter are present, then the Agent is also an instance of
   CognitiveAgent. Domesticated animals are an example of SentientAgents that are
   not also CognitiveAgents.

   DOLCE: agent:  A catch-all class used to join agentive objects (either physical or social).
   Agents are dispositionally so, in the sense that they internally represent 
   descriptions, and in particular plans, goals and possible actions, but they do not
   necessarily act. In everyday language, agent is used in this sense, but also
   to tell that something has acted in a certain way, or to say that something has 
   an initiator or leading role in some action. In DLP, the performs relation encodes
   these notions.</rdfs:comment>

    DOLCE only:  'agentive-social-object' A social object that is assumed
     to internally represent a plan. Since social objects are dependent
     on physical ones, it is not trivial to interpret the local sense in
     which a social object 'internally represents' a plan. For example,
     an institution can have the plan to promote or regulate some activities,
     but this is possible by means of the powers conferred to it by some 
     legal system, through its representatives, and that plan has to be 
     executed by means of the physical agents that 'act for' the institution.</rdfs:comment>

    >An IntelligentAgent is an agent that can form plans, use knowledge in plans,
    and can communicate in language.  Among the natural animals, only people
    qualify for this status - in this respect, this category differs from
    the definition given by Cyc (below). Groups of people, or organizations
    whose acts are in fact carried out by people (or machines directed by people),
    can be considered as IntelligentAgents - by the convention that the acts 
    carried out by people who are authorized to act in the name of an organization 
    are acts of the organization. (see Organization).  To some degree, existing or 
    future computers may also have such a capacity, and would fit into this category, 
    even if the range of linguistic inputs that would generate an appropriate response may be much more 
    limited than for an adult human;'intelligence' is therefore a quantitative
    attribute, which has a range of values.   NOTE that this category needs to be
    carefully axiomatized so that the system will recognize blocking
    conditions that may prevent the understanding of language in specific
    circumstances: for example, an individual person will only understand
    one or a small number of languages; a person will understand language only
    when conscious and awake, and able to perceive the input.  A human baby will
    not understand language at birth, and will develop that capacity 
    gradually; nevertheless a human baby is an instance of this Type.
    Implementing the use of such blocking conditions will be complex, but
    including any agent type that can normally understand some human
    or near-human language appears to be preferable to creating a
    subtype of human that can qualify absolutely as understanding language,
    without conditions.
    
    NOTE that a Person is an IntelligentAgent, and therefore a DeadPerson
    is also an IntelligentAgent. In most circumstances, one would not
    consider a DeadPerson as being able to understand language, unless
    one is within a belief systems where spirits sruvive bodily death.
    Death is one of the potential blocjing conditions for language
    understanding that will need to be interpreted in context.

    This is similar to the Cyc #$IntelligentAgent,but excludes non-human animals:
    From Cyc:  A specialization of #$Agent-Generic (q.v.) whose instances are 
    all agents capable of knowing and acting, and of employing their knowledge
    in their actions.  An intelligent agent #$knowsAbout certain things,
    and having #$beliefs (and possibly #$goals) concerning those things may 
    influence its actions.  As with agents generally, an intelligent agent 
    might be a single individual or might consist of a group of individual 
    agents (see #$MultiIndividualAgent).  Thus persons are intelligent agents, 
    and so are certain social beings like business and government organizations. 
    Some non-human instances of #$Vertebrate that seem to be sentient and
    somewhat intelligent, such as (arguably) dogs and horses, can also be considered 
    intelligent agents.</rdfs:comment>

In COSMO, this type includes any region on or near the surface of a planet,
  including the region that contains its atmosphere.  But the usage here 
  differs from that in Cyc, and this category is not a physical object.
  For physical objects at the surface of a planet, see
  'PlanetarySurfaceObject'.
  
    Cyc comment:    A specialization of #$GeographicalThing and
            #$Surface-Physical.  Each instance of #$GeographicalRegion
            is a tangible spatial region that includes some piece of the
            surface of a planet (usually #$PlanetEarth), and may be
            represented on a map of the planet.  This includes purely
            topographical regions like mountains and underwater spaces,
            places defined by demographics (e.g., language areas) and
            territory otherwise demarcated (e.g. #$TimeZones).  In
            dualist  geopolitical contexts [see
            #$DualistGeopoliticalMt], instances of #$GeopoliticalEntity
            are also considered to be instances of #$GeographicalRegion.
            In all cases the region in question must contain some
            tangible component with which it is possible to make
            physical contact.  The instances of #$GeographicalRegion
            contrast in this respect with the instances of
            #$GeographicalThing-Intangible, which are wholly intangible.
            Examples of #$GeographicalRegion include

        In COSMO, it is a region of space, and is neither a physical object nor
        a physical substance.  This Type differs from Cyc in that
        a FreeSpaceRegion is a Region in which PhysicalObjects can move, as in Cyc, but 
        it is only the space, and not the contents of that space.  Thus
        large parts of the Ocean are FreeSpaceRegion, as in Cyc, but 
        the water in that region is merely present or located in that region,
        the water is not the region itself.

            instances of #$EmptySpaceRegion (q.v.)): space regions
            through which solid objects can move more or less freely.
            Examples include the #$Air in the interior of a room or the
            sky above a city.  In an underwater context, a piece of free
            space content is likely to be an instance of #$Water. Often,
            a #$FreeSpaceContent is associated with a geographical
            region or some physical boundaries that define its edges.

            #$Surface-Open has some boundary, such as an edge,
            perimeter, or hole.  Examples include the top surface of a
            tabletop, the surface of a whiffle ball, a slightly cracked
            eggshell, and the skin of an apple with a bite taken from
            it.  Non-examples are a basketball skin and an intact
            eggshell; cf. #$Surface-Closed.  Note that 'hole'
            here is intended in its colloquial, human-scale sense,
            according to which (e.g.) a wiffle ball has holes but a
            baseball does not (even though at some fine-grained level
            the latter does have tiny holes).</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>Each GeographicalRegion is a connected one-,two- or
      three-dimensional region of space located on or near 
      the surface of some astronomical body, not necessarily the Earth.
      For 3-dimensonal regions specifically on the Earth, use 'GeographicalArea'.
      It is understood that the regions defined are stationary with respect to 
      some coordinate system in which the astronomical object itself is
      considered to be stationary.  The  astronomical object itself
      (most commonly the Earth) will of course be rotating and 
      moving through space, and those motions are ignored when the relative
      locations defined by 'GeographicalRegion' are used.  A GeographicalRegion
      will include some portion of the space above the solid material that
      defines the region, and below the surface; at this point (v 0.44) we 
      have not precisely specified how much of the space above or below
      the surface is included.
    
    COSMO note: this Cyc category is reinterpreted as representing only
         spatial regions - points, areas, or volumes, on or
         near the surface of some planetary body (to clearly
         specify the Earth, use the subtype 'GeographicalArea'), but this
         does not represent any of the physical objects that might exist in that
         region.  The discussion of 'tangible' in the Cyc documentation below
         suggests the inclusion of physical objects, but that is not the intent
         of this  COSMO cateegory.  Though this category does not include any
         physical objects, one may use 'GeographicalObject' to specify all of the
         objects in any GeographicalRegion, if desired.
         
         Cyc:  A specialization of #$GeographicalThing and
            #$Surface-Physical.  Each instance of #$GeographicalRegion
            is a tangible spatial region that includes some piece of the
            surface of a planet (usually #$PlanetEarth), and may be
            represented on a map of the planet.  This includes purely
            topographical regions like mountains and underwater spaces,
            places defined by demographics (e.g., language areas) and
            territory otherwise demarcated (e.g. #$TimeZones).  In
            dualist  geopolitical contexts [see
            #$DualistGeopoliticalMt], instances of #$GeopoliticalEntity
            are also considered to be instances of #$GeographicalRegion.
            In all cases the region in question must contain some
            tangible component with which it is possible to make
            physical contact.  The instances of #$GeographicalRegion
            contrast in this respect with the instances of
            #$GeographicalThing-Intangible, which are wholly intangible.
            Examples of #$GeographicalRegion include
            #$RockyMountainStates-USRegion, the #$ContinentOfAustralia,
            #$SinaiPeninsula, and - in  dualist  geopolitical contexts
            - #$YaleUniversity and #$CityOfPittsburghPA.  Some
            important types of regions are represented by the

    <rdfs:comment>GeographicalArea is (in spite of its name) a three-dimensional Region
      of space that is  on or close to the surface of the Earth.  This is 
      the category that should be used to specify areas of the Earth, such 
      as the areas defined  by  Countries and ruled by their governments.  Although
      three-dimensional, most GeographicalAreas will be relatively thin 
      and sheet-like in shape, as the areas of interest are close to the Earth's surface.
    
      COSMO note: in Cyc this was 'GeographicalRegion'.  In COSMO,
      Geographical reasoning uses only the spatial points, areas
      and volumes that are defined relative to some set of Geodetic 
      coordinates.  The physical objects that occupy that region
      are related to the region, but are classified separately under
     'GeographicalObject'.
    
    Note that to be consistent with SUMO usage, one-and two-dimensional
    regions are not included in this categeory.  They can be represented by
    'GeographicalRegion'.
    
    GeographicalArea (SUMO) includes Earth areas only
    SUMO:  A geographic location on Earth, generally having definite boundaries.
        
    SUMO: Note that this differs from its immediate superclass Region in that
    a GeographicArea is a three-dimensional Region of the earth.
    Accordingly, all astronomical objects other than earth and all one-dimensional
    and two-dimensional Regions are not classed under
    GeographicArea.</rdfs:comment>

    Called 'SpaceRegion' in Cyc and SUMO:
    Cyc: A specialization of both #$SpatialThing and

            of space that exclusively act as possible locations for
            other spatial objects, and thus are immobile.  A space
            region might be three-, two-, one-, or zero-dimensional; and
            spatial objects  occupy  such regions accordingly.
            Three-dimensional space regions (see #$ChunkOfSpace) can be
            occupied by solid objects.   Two-dimensional space regions
            (or #$SpaceSurfaces) can be occupied by a purely
            two-dimensional objects.  And similarly for one-dimensional
            space regions (#$SpaceLines) and zero-dimensional space
            regions (#$SpacePoints).  Another important specialization
            of #$SpaceRegion is #$SpaceRegion-Empirical, whose instances
            are pieces of the embedding space for spatio-temporal
            objects (see #$SpatialThing-Localized). For more on spatial

    >isaPartOf is a very general 'part' relation applicable to spatial 
    regions or objects in some space. This relation has no axioms associated
    with it because  it is only an 'umbrella' relation that gathers together
    other relations having different meaning, so as to provide
    an anchor point for the ambiguous linguistic notion of 'part'
    It cannot be transitive, because it subsumes the relation of
    a member to the group, which is not transitive.  But some of
    its subrelations are transitive.
    
    NOTE: this and its subproperties are instance-level relations.
     To express that some physical object type is typically a part
     of another physical object type, use the type-level relation,
     'isTypicallyaPhysicalPartOf'</rdfs:comment>

       >An AgentiveObject is a PhysicalObject that can cause changes to other objects.
       This class contains subclasses that have the capacity to act as agents, i.e. 
       to cause changes in the real world; but this general class of agents do not have
       to have intentions or form plans..  People are the Agents that are typically 
       of greatest interest.  But Tornadoes,  hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanoes, etc. 
       can behave a agents in that they cause external events due to their internal 
       processes.  All of these agentic objects are included in this category, but 
       Organizations, which are classified as MentalObjects in this ontology, are 
       in a separate agentive category.</rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:comment>A TemporalLocation is a location for something -
    usually an Event - in the universal time line of
    our real world, or some alternative reality.  It may be a time interval or a point in time.
    Instances of TemporalLocation may be represented by a DateTimeString ,
    without being reified as an actual instance of this Type.
    
    This category includes the conceptual 'Datetime' Entity that is pointed
     to by the common relations like 'CREATION_DATETIME' that occur in
     databases.  This entity is often represented by a built-in
     dataype of 'DateTime' or something similar.  In COSMO, a DateTime
     is represented by subtpyes of DateTimeString, an AbstractString.
     
     A location in time can serve as a Context, which is anything that can
     affect the truth of a statement.  In the real world, virtually
     every statement about real-world objects is true only in some
     particular time interval.
     
     RELATIVITY: Time is assumed in COSMO to be measured by some
     clock, which by default is the NIST atomic clock set,
     but can be specified as some other clock.
     Thus a time slice of a spatiotemporal region will be unambiguous,
     and observers moving relative to that clock, or relative to each other,
     need to adjust their interpretation according to the equations of relativity.
     
     In COSMO there is a superfluous subtype link of this entity to the
     most general 'Thing' so that 'time' will be exposed to viewers
     of this ontology at the highest level in Protege, for perspicuity.
     
     ******** NOTE on BFO 'TemporalRegion' ***********************
     The BFO 'TemporalRegion' appears to be the closest BFO Type to 
     the COSMO 'TemporalLocation'.  
     BFO Definition ('TemporalRegion'): An occurrent that is part of time.
         
     BFO: Examples ('TemporalRegion'): the time it takes to run a marathon,
     the duration of a surgical procedure, the moment of death
     
     COOSMO note: this is not a *quantity* of time, as the BFO example
     might suggest, but a *location* in time. 'ten minutes' is not 
     an instance of 'TemporalLocation'.

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="TimeInterval">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#TemporalLocation"/>
    <rdfs:comment>TimeInterval is not a quantity of time (what is measured by a stopwatch), but a
     specific region of the time  line, what is measured by a calendar (in our real world
     or in some hypothetical world).  
     Called: TimeInterval(Cyc); TimeInterval(SUMO - but SUMO requires contiguous
     intervals); time-interval(DOLCE) or period_in_time(ISO15926); the BFO equivalents
     of TimeInterval ('TemporalInterval') and TimePoint ('TemporalInstant') are disjoint 
     in BFO, but a TimePoint is a subtype of TimeInterval in COSMO.

     COSMO NOTE: as a convenience, a calendar time interval can be given a name
     that conforms to the conventions of one of the DateTime strings defined
     in COSMO, such as a 'DateTimeExtendedGroup', providing an opportunity for
     an interpreter to recognize the referenced time interval solely from the name
     of the instance.  See the example used in defining the TimeAndPlace
     'WorldTradeCenter20010911'.

    In Cyc, TimeInterval is not a measure.
    SUMO: An interval of time.  Note that a TimeInterval has both an extent and
    a location on the universal timeline.  Note too that a TimeInterval has no gaps, i.e. 
    this class contains only convex time intervals.

    OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
    A specialization of #$TemporalThing. Each instance of #$TimeInterval is a temporal thing 
    characterized fully by its temporal attributes. For example, the year A.D. 1967 is an instance
    of #$TimeInterval; although many interesting things happened during that year, the year itself
    is completely defined by its temporal extent. On the other hand, the event of Neil Armstrong's
    walking on the Moon is an #$Event and not a #$TimeInterval, since it is not fully characterized
    by its temporal extent or other temporal attributes. Specializations of #$TimeInterval include
    #$CalendarYear, #$CalendarMonth, and #$FiscalQuarter.

     DOLCE: a region - (Space and Time are special kinds of regions, i.e. AttributeValues or measures)
     A temporal region, measured according to a calendar.
     
     NOTE that a redundant subtype link to 'SituationProcessEventOrState'
     is included just to make it easier to find TimeInterval in a drill-down search.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="TimePoint">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#TimeInterval"/>
    <rdfs:comment>A TimePoint is a closed interval of time having zero length.  The beginning TimePoint 
      and Ending TimePoint are identical for any given TimePoint.  The representation of a TimePoint
      as a zero-length time interval is only an alternate view of a TimePoint.

           (hasStartingTimePoint ?TP ?TP)
           (hasEndingTimePoint ?TP ?TP)))
   
      A TimePoint is classified here as a subclass of TimeInterval because we adopt
       the interpretation that a time interval of zero length duration is indistinguishable 
       from a time point.  We know from special relativity that time may proceed at different
       rates in objects that are moving relative to each other, so all time values must be
       relative to some clock.  In the absence of any explicit clock designation, the 
       NIST atomic clock signals transmitted from Boulder Colorado are considered as the clock 
       of reference.
       
       A TimePoint may be represented by a limit expression, e.g. 'before Jan 1 2008',
       or by a range ('some time point between Jan 1 200 and Jan 1 2008').  This
       allows incomplete time information to be entered when not known exactly.  This 
       may be implemented by a functional expression, but is not yet formalized in 
       COSMO version 0.44.

    <rdfs:comment>A SpatialRegion can be of any dimension, though the ones of most interest
    are three-dimensional in our real world.  All Regions must have their location 
    referenced to some definable object, whether abstract or physical.  In theory,
    it may be possible to consider the whole universe as an Object and define
    'absolute' regions based on locations in the whole universe, but that may not
    be useful for any practical purpose.  The regions of greatest interest to people 
    are regions defined relative to the Earth's surface, which forms a moving 
    rotating frame of reference, which we treat as stationary for most purposes.

    COSMO Note: SpaceRegion in OpenCyc is not an Object, but pure space. Objects may
    be located in space.  This region is part our our Space-Time
    This concepts is roughly equivalent to the OpenCyc 'ChunkOfSpace-Empirical', but
    we allow space regions to be defined by their relation to physical objects -
    therefore they may not be 'immobile' as the Cyc documentation suggests for
    'ChunkOfSpace-Empirical'.

    For simplicity, the Cyc concept 'SpaceRegion-Empirical' has been
    merged with this concept, as the distinctions did not seem to 
    have sufficient importance to justify the complexity.

        #$SpatialThing-Localized (qq.v.).
        Instances of #$ChunkOfSpace-Empirical are three-dimensional portions

        This is the kind of space that physical objects occupy.

        Cyc comment for 'SpaceRegion-Empirical':  A specialization
        of #$SpaceRegion, #$SpatialThing-Localized, and #$IntangibleExistingThing
            (qq.v.).  Instances of #$SpaceRegion-Empirical are
            intangible regions of space located in the empirically
            observable universe.  A space region might or might not be
            connected (see #$SpatiallyContinuousThing).  It might be
            partially or completely filled with (occupied by)
            #$PartiallyTangibles, or it might be completely empty (but
            cf. #$EmptySpaceRegion).  In any case, the space region
            itself is not to be confused with a physical object or other
            spatially localized (non-space-region) thing that might
            happen to be #$cospatial with it.  A given space region can
            be characterized fully merely by specifying its location and
            dimensions.  Thus (although this is not the case with
            spatial things in general), space regions are identical
            (#$equals) if and only if they are #$cospatial.
            #$SpaceRegion-Empirical is in a way the spatial analogue of
            #$TimeInterval, whose own instances can be fully
            characterized by specifying their temporal properties; these
            two collections can be used, respectively, to talk about
            space and time as  dimensions .  Specializations of
            #$SpaceRegion-Empirical include #$SpacePoint-Empirical,
            #$SpaceLine-Empirical, #$SpaceSurface-Empirical,
            and #$ChunkOfSpace-Empirical.

   OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
   A specialization of #$SpatialThing whose instances are regions of space that exclusively act
   as locations for other spatial objects, and thus are immobile. Instances of #$SpatialThing are
   said to occupy some region of space. Three dimensional regions of space [#$ChunkOfSpace] can be
   occupied by solid objects, see the specialization #$ChunkOfSpace-Empirical for the regions of
   space occupied by physical objects. Purely two-dimensional objects occupy a #$SpaceSurface, see
   also #$SpaceLine and #$SpacePoint-Empirical for objects of lower dimension. Note that an object
   of a given dimension cannot truly be located [#$exactlyLocatedAt-Spatial] at a region of space 
   of lower dimension, but only partially or incidentally. For more information on location and
   occupancy, see #$AbsoluteLocationalPredicate and its instances that relate objects in space 
   and their regions. An important specialization of #$SpaceRegion is #$SpaceRegion-Empirical, whose instances are pieces of the embedding space where spatio-temporal objects are empirically localizable [#$SpatialThing-Localized].

            geographical agent GEO-AGENT. In a 'dualist' geography

            are viewed as being _both_ agents _and_ land masses

            (Despite their somewhat paradoxical flavor, dualist

     <rdfs:comment>COSMO: A GeopoliticalEntity in COSMO differs from its representation
     in other ontologies, to stay closer to the linguistic intuitions.
     Specifically, we say 'government of France', implying that the entity
     'France' is not identical to its governemnt.  Therefore a GeopoliticalEntity
     is something distinct from the organization which forms the government.  In COSMO,
     it is an unusual hybrid, being both a MentalObject and a GenericLocation.
     
     A GeopoliticalEntity in COSMO is a composite Entity which
      (1) is an agent
      (2) claims control over some land area of the earth
      (3) has a government or other ruling organization, which is also an agent
      (4) is a MentalObject, meaning that it does not have mass and was created by
          an IntelligentAgent
      
      NOTE1: As a GenericLocation, one can say that something isLocatedAt a GeopoliticalEntity
      even though one means that an object isLocatedAt the region controlled by the
      GeopoliticalEntity.  When an instance of a GeopoliticalEntity is used as an
      argument that should logically take a region, the implementation should,
      for consistency, coerce the argument into the corresponding GeopoliticalArea.
      At present (v0.43) there is no 'disjoint' relation that will cause a logical
      contradiction, but elaboration of the ontology might cause problems at some
      point for the use of an Agent as a Location.  Alternatives may be worth
      exploring.
      
      NOTE2: if the government performs an action, it is unclear whether it is alway proper
      to say that a country (or city) performed that action.  Therefore the
      GeopoliticalEntity and its government are treated as distinct agents, though
      it will probably be true in almost all cases that when one acts, the other
      can be said to act.
      
      NOTE3 that countries have four aspects:
        (1) the country itself, the GeopoliticalEntity
        (2) the government of the country
        (3) the spatial region controlled by the counry
        (4) the physical objects within the spatial region controlled by the country.
          (4.1) among the physical objects are those that are part of the land, including the
          vegetation, and those that are animals or artifactual structures.
          
       In normal speech, the distinctions among these are not made because the referents
       are clear from the context.  For this ontology, the distinctions appear necessary.       
    
    A GeopoliticalEntity usually has an Organization that claims control over the 
    geographical region identified as the area of the GeopoliticalEntity. Usually this
    will be a government, but occasionally other Organizations such as occupying
    armies will claim control without claiming to be a 
    formal government.  This concept differs from the OpenCyc #$GeopoliticalEntity in that
    it is strictly an organization, whereas the Cyc concept includes some element of 
    the geographical region itself.  The Cyc documentation is reproduced here to clarify 
    the difference:

    Cyc:  A specialization of #$Organization and of
            #$LegalAgent and of #$GeographicalAgent; instances of this
            collection control #$GeographicalRegions.  Each instance of
            #$GeopoliticalEntity includes a governing body, but is more
            than just that governing body.  Important subcollections
            include #$Country, #$IndependentCountry,
            #$State-Geopolitical, #$City, and #$Province.  Instances
            include #$CityOfTokyoJapan, #$BronxNY-Borough,
            #$Alaska-State, #$Rwanda, #$Singapore, #$InnerMongolia,
            #$Somerset-CountyEngland, and #$Taiwan-RepublicOfChina.  A
            central feature of this collection is that
            geopolitical-entities (indeed, all  #$GeographicalAgents)
            are viewed in two significantly different ways with respect
            to two different types of geography-related microtheories.
            In a  physical  geography microtheory (i.e.
            #$PhysicalGeographyMt and its submicrotheories),
            geopolitical-entities are clearly distinguished from the
            regions they control.  (#$TerritoryFn GEO-POL) is used in
            these contexts to denote the land mass (a
            #$GeopoliticalRegion) of a given geopolitical-entity
            GEO-POL.  In a  dualist  geography microtheory (i.e.
            #$DualistGeopoliticalMt and its submicrotheories), on the
            other hand, geopolitical-entities are viewed as being _both_
            agents _and_ land masses (i.e. #$GeographicalRegions).
            Thus, there is little need for #$TerritoryFn in the latter
            sort of context.  (Despite their somewhat paradoxical
            flavor, dualist microtheories arguably allow Cyc to mimic
            commonsense reasoning about geopolitical entities and
            regions more closely than do the stricter physicalist
            microtheories.)  There are also some  generic  geography
            microtheories (e.g. #$WorldGeographyMt and
            #$UnitedStatesGeographyMt) which are neutral with respect to
            the physical and dualist views.  Also see the shared-note

    This subsumes both the symbolic objects that people may create as well as 
    the yet more abstract informational content ('propositional content') which 
    may be viewed as existing independent of the symbols used to encode it.

    'Information' has not been well defined yet, so this category does not have

    AbstractSymbolicObjects, Propositions, and Languages.  Every Communication
    transfers some InformationObject.

    DOLCE; Information objects are social objects. They are realized by
    some entity. They are ordered (expressed according to) by some system 
    for information encoding. Consequently, they are dependent from an encoding 
    as well as from a concrete realization.They can express a description
    (the ontological equivalent of a meaning/conceptualization), can be about
    any entity, and can be interpreted by an agent.From a communication perspective,
    an information object can play the role of 'message'. From a semiotic perspective, it plays the role of 'expression'.

    >A AbstractSymbolicObject is a mental object which is created to serve 
    as a Symbol, i.e. to represent something other than itself. 
    This is not a physical object, but more abstract, such as the letter 'a',
    which may have representations in billions of different physical objects,
    but retains its identity as the unique (Roman alphabet) letter 'a'.  
    Every SymbolicObject is represented in at least one PhysicalObject,
    even if only the brain of the person who created it.  The more 
    interesting SymbolicObjects are texts and documents.
    
    This Type is approximately equal to,and merged with,
       the Cyc 'AbstractInformationStructure'
    From Cyc:
    OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002\  A subcollection of #$AbstractInformationalThing whose 
    instances involve symbols standing in certain relations to one another.
    Important specializations include #$CharacterString and #$Sentence.
    #$AbstractInformationStructure also includes abstract diagrams, graphs,
    and bit strings. The collection can be more precisely defined as follows:
    Each #$AbstractInformationStructure is such that each of its physical
    instantiations (see #$instantiationOfAIS) consists of instantiations of
    instances of #$AtomicSymbol-Abstract, arranged in a certain way.
    For example, the abstract sentence 'The pig flies' is an #$AbstractInformationStructure.
    Each written instantiation of it consists of an instantiation of 
    the words (symbols) 'The', 'pig' and 'flies', written in that order.
    (If the #$AbstractInformationStructure 'The pig flies' were spoken, the same 
    words would appear in the same order, i.e. 'The' first, etc., but the sequence
    would be determined by the arrangement of the words in time, rather than space.)
    Likewise with abstract diagrams, graphs, etc. Each of these is such that their 
    physical instantiations consist of arrangements of instantiations of instances
    of #$AtomicSymbol-Abstract. A hard copy of a wiring diagram consists of a
    group of concrete symbols representing various circuit components, in which 
    these symbols are spatially arranged in a certain in way. The arrangement of 
    the concrete symbols in an instantiation of an #$AbstractInformationStructure 
    is not always a simple matter of arrangement in space or time. The sequence of 
    symbols '0010010111011001' can be instantiated in written, spoken,
    or electronic forms. In the last case, the order of the symbols is determined
    by conventions concerning the electronic medium in which it is stored,
    rather than by any common criterion for precedence or subsequence
    in space or time.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Description">
    <rdfs:comment>description (from DOLCE-D_S)
     From DOLCE (Descriptions and Specifications): A description is a social object 
     which represents a conceptualization (e.g. a mental object or state), hence it
     is generically dependent on some agent and communicable. Descriptions define 
     or use concepts or figures, are expressed by an information object and can be 
     satisfied by situations. The typology of descriptions is still preliminary.

     In COSMO, a Description is somewhat more specific: it is two or more assertions 
     that all include the same entity as one of the arguments, and it is a MentalObject
     created to enable an Intelli"gentAgent to understand the nature of that entity.</rdfs:comment>

    >COSMO: A Specification is a broad category of intentionally created abstract
    informational artifacts whose purpose is to describe the structure of a thing or 
    a series of steps that may be taken to construct a thing or to accomplish a goal.
    It is a mental object having ordered components,the order of which
    is designed to accomplish a purpose.  The steps may be abstract
    things like computational events or game rules, or physical things such
    as in industrial processes. The format of a formatted document is a
    specification,i.e. it specifies how a document
    of that type is to be constructed.  Likewise a grammar or computer
    program is a specification.

   A specification does not necessarily require that the steps be in sequence.
      If they must be in sequence, it is a procedure.
      
      This  differs somewhat from the Cyc 'Specification':
        Cyc comment:  A specialization of #$ConceptualWork. Each
            instance of #$Specification is an abstract work that
            constitutes a description of the properties of a #$Situation
            or a #$SomethingExisting, and sometimes even entire
            collections of such things.  Things are made, bought, and
            searched for according to specifications, which can be
            instantiated as printed instructions or as diagrams.  This
            collection is modally neutral with regard to the descriptive
            character of its instances. Thus, it includes descriptions
            of how things are, were, should be, must be, etc.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="InformationBearingThing">
        <rdfs:comment>A collection of spatially-localized  individuals,
            including various actions and events as well as physical
            objects.  Each instance of #$InformationBearingThing (or
            IBT ) is an  item that contains information (for an agent
            who knows how to interpret it).   Examples: a copy of the
            novel Moby Dick; a signal buoy; a
            photograph; an  elevator sign in Braille; a map; a US dollar
            bill; a resume; a musical score;  copies of the
            #$CycProgram.    For representations of the propositional
            content  of information bearing things, see
            #$PropositionalInformationThing; but note  that not all IBTs
            have a propositional content (cf. #$ArtObject).  An
            important specialization of #$InformationBearingThing is
            #$InformationBearingObject,  which comprises all of those
            IBTs that are also physical objects (i.e.
            #$PartiallyTangibles).  Though often a subtle task in
            particular contexts,  it is important to distinguish the
            various specializations of  #$InformationBearingThing from
            those of #$AspatialInformationStore (whose  instances are
            the chunks of information instantiated in particular IBTs;
            see #$instantiationOfAIT) and from those of #$ConceptualWork
            (whose  instances are the conceptual or artistic creations
            that are instantiated  in particular IBTs; see
            #$instantiationOfWork).    For instance, #$TextString  is a
            specialization of #$AspatialInformationStore,
            #$TextualMaterial is  a specialization of
            #$InformationBearingThing, and #$TextualPCW is a
            specialization of #$ConceptualWork; to conflate any of these
            with  another would be to make a  category error .  Also
            note that events  in which information is transferred (see
            #$InformationTransferEvent) are  not considered instances of
            #$InformationBearingThing.  Rather, such  transfer events
            have as one of their participants (see #$actors) some
            instance of #$InformationBearingThing; though in cases where
            IBTs are  themselves events this will require distinguishing
            very finely between  the event that encodes the information
            and the event that is the information transfer.  See also

            generally, lists allow for repetition of their members, so
            that the same item can appear at multiple member-positions
            in the same list.  A list can be represented formally as a
            function from a finite index set of counting numbers,

            note that #$Lists are _not_ explicitly represented as

            #$Series (q.v.), a list is purely abstract (i.e. both

            between an item and its successor in a list is the successor
            relation of the list itself.  Technically, #$List is more
            specific than #$Tuple only in that the index set (see

            numbers in their usual order (or some initial segment

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="CapturedImage">
    <rdfs:comment>A CapturedImage is an AbstractImage that was produced by 
      some ImageCaptureEvent.  The production of the CapturedImage must be
      accompanied by production of a corresponding PhysicalImage in some
      medium - paper, electronic, plastic, or an other.  A single CapturedImage
      is represented by one or more PhysicalImages, and the CapturedImage
      exists only as long as one of the physical representations exist.
      A series of images representing a time sequence (a Movie) consists
      of multiple CapturedImages, and is classified elsewhere(@ToDo).
      A CapturedImage should represent objective information about the
      shape-related features of some object(s).
      
      An ImageCaptureEvent may be. e.g., taking a photograph,
      performing an MRI, PET scan, or an X-ray, taking fingerprints, or 
      any other mechanical, electronic, or optical process that creates a
      representation of the shape of some object without the
      need for human manipulation of the actual captured image. Therefore
      painting a picture is not an ImageCaptureEvent, and a painting is
      not a CapturedImage in this sense.  Infrared photographs that represent
      temperature distribution oer some physical object are CapturedImages,
      providing that the shape relations of the parts are preserved.
      A photograph (abstract) at any wavelength is a CapturedImage.
      
      NOTE that a device that creates an image by means other than simple
      photography may still produce a CapturedImage.  An ElectronMicroscope
      produces a CapturedImage.  However, a spectrograph that produces
      an image of the spectrum of a substance or sample does not
      produce a CapturedImage.  A CapturedImage must represent the
      shape features (external or internal) of some physical object(s),
      even if those features are not perceptible through visible light.
      Representations of other features of physical objects, whether or
      not those representations are captured on a readable medium, are
      classified elsewhere. (@ToDo - )</rdfs:comment>

    COSMO note: Cyc interprets IBO to include utterances and gestures, but in
    COSMO this category is restricted to physical objects that are
    artifacts ('ArtifactObjects'), and excludes
    actions.  In COSMO actions that contain information are included
    under 'InformationBearingThing'.

    OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
    A specialization of both #$InformationBearingThing and #$CompositeTangibleAndIntangibleObject.
    Each instance of #$InformationBearingObject is an object that can be interpreted,
    by an interpreter understanding its conventions, to yield a chunk or chunks of information. 
    #$InformationBearingObject includes all of the following: (1) artifacts made solely for 
    the purpose of conveying information (e.g., a newspaper, or a children's science video);
    (2) artifacts that convey information in addition to their intended function (e.g.,
    Neolithic pottery); and (3) non-artifacts, such as a person's fingerprints, gestures, 
    and utterances, which may be interpreted to yield information. 
    Note: 'an IBO' abbreviates 'an information bearing object'.
    Cf. #$InformationBearingWavePropagation. See also #$containsInformation.

     COSMO note: this category is considerd approximately equivalent to the 
     SUMO 'ContentbearingObject'
     SUMO:  (ContentBearingObject) Any SelfConnectedObject that expresses 
     content.  This content may be a Proposition, e.g. when the ContentBearingObject

     Note that in this ontology, the 'AbstractString' can be named in any way.
     The actual string representation, if not a single word, will generally be 
     found by finding the datatype  value of the relation 'hasStringRepresentation'
     for the AbstractString that represents the entity.  This convoluted way of
     finding the string representation is made necessary by the requirements of
     implementation in computers, and the unique name requirement for

    <rdfs:comment>A DateTimeExtendedGroup is a DateTimeString having at least 
    4 numerical characters, and possible one or two decimal points.  The format described
    here is intended to allow use of an interpretable and and time as the name of
    an instance in an ontology, by avoiding special characters that might be rejected
    in entity names by some ontology editors (such as '+').    The interpretation
    will depend on the length of the string. For time zones, Zulu (GMT, London Time) is the
    default unless specified by a 'Z' after the day and time.  Any base string can be 
    suffixed with 'Z' for ZULU time or 'ZN' or Z-N' for ZULU plus or minus some
    number of hours (if there  is no hyphen after the 'Z', any number is interpreted
    as Zulu plus that number of hours.  Zulu time references may have fractional
    hours, such as 'Z5.5' to allow for time zones that are one-half hour
    offset from a full hour.  If hours are included, a 'T' must come after 
    the day (similar to the usage in xsd datetime).  The HH hour is always by a 24-hour clock,  
    No suffix implies Zulu time.  To create an ontology instance of TimeInterval
    with a unique name, use the prefix 'DTEG' in front of the number.  In a database,
    the prefix can be omitted.  We do not use the colon to separate the
    fields because that character is not accepted in the names of
    elements some ontology tools.
    
    If any era other than AD/BC (CE/BCE) is intended, it should use a different
     prefix than DTEG.

                                are more than 8 digits before the 'T', the year
                                field is extended beyond 9999; if a minus
                                sign precedes the first digit, the year is 
                                interpreted as BC (BCE), but the dates and times
                                are still of normal positive value within that year.
                                
     The ides of March in 44 BC in Rome would be 'DTEG-00440315Z1'.
     
                                
     COSMO note:  This Type defines an abstract string, but the strings defined
     by this type can be used as surrogate labels for instances of TimeInterval,
     providing an opportunity for an interpreter to identify the intended
     time interval solely from the name of the instance.  In that case, no
     instance of a time interval need actually be created, but the intended
     time interval can be identified by the format described in this Type.
     The implementation will have the option of interpreting a DTEG string
     as being a time interval.
     
     The format will be recognized by using a distinctive prefix, such
     as 'DTEG' for the name. This distinctive prefix is reserved as a unique
     instance of 'CodeListPrefix' in this ontology.  An implementation should
     also reserve these prefixes, if possible.
     
     NOTE1: although the format listing above does not illustrate the format
     of years after 9999, an interpreter could adopt the convention that an odd 
     number of digits (or of digits before the period) means that a year in the range
     10000 to 99999 is being represented.  For years beyond that point, including 
     the  'T' after the day would be mandatory in the name,to 
     avoid ambiguity about the length of the year field.  A minus sign
     after the DTEG prefix and before the year means that the year should
     be interpreted as BC (BCE), though the months and days retain their
     same interpretation within that year.
     
     If it is quite certain that the represented dates will never be 
     before 1 AD or after 9999, a hyphen or more than 14 digits plus a 'T' before
     the decimal could be interpreted as format errors.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="DateTimeInterval">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#DateTimeString"/>
    <rdfs:comment>A DateTimeInterval consists of a pair of DateTimeString,
    each being a DatetimeExtendedGroup (DTEG).  This can be used to represent
    a TimeInterval that includes the first DTEG and the last DTEG, and all times in 
    between the two.  Since a DTEG can have arbitrary precision, this can be
    used to specify time intervals at any level of precision.  A prefix of 'DTI'
    (defined as the recomended CodeListPrefix for a DateTimeInterval) should be used.
    A hyphen (or two hyphens, for easier reading when a 'Z' is included)
    can be used in the name to separate the starting and ending
    DTEGs.  The decade of the 1990's can be represented as:
          'DTI19900101-19991231'  (in London) 
          'DTI19900101Z-5--19991231Z-5'  (in New York) 
    For intervals of significant precision, the name of an instance could get quite long.
    
    If the length of the name required would be considered too long,
    the starting and ending time intervals can be referenced
    explicitly using the 'startsAt' and 'endsAt' relations, which
    take a DTEG as the value.
    
    NOTE: this type can also be used to represent a series of disconnected
    time intervals (an instance of 'ScatteredTemporalRegion').  There is no maximum
    cardinality restriction on the 'startsAt' and 'endsAt' relations, so multiple starts
    and ends will be interpreted as meanings that the time interval being represented
    has more than one discontinuous component.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#AttributeValue"/>
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#RealizableEntity"/>
    <rdfs:comment>COSOMO note: 'Tendency' is an AttributeType that specifies
      how objects will normally behave over some interval of time.  In BFO this 
      Type is called 'Disposition' but the term 'Tendency' is used in COSMO.
      This high-level category is very general.  Specializations of
      'Tendency' can attributes of inanimate objects or of animate objects,
      and can point to simple physical behavior, such as the tendency of 
      heavier-than-air objects to fall to the Earth, or of chemical behavior,
      such as the tendency of organic materials to decompose, or of
      animal and human behavior, such as the tendency of animnals to get hungry
      over time, the tendency of geographical features (e.g. mountains) to stay where
      they are for a very long time.  The properties referenced by a Tendency may also be
      implied in other relations (such as the laws of physics, chemistry and biology),
      but the 'Tendency' Type is useful to provide a cumulative aggregated description of
      the *significant*  behaviors of objects that are likely to affect the course
      of events in some real-world situation.  In a way, assigning a Tendency
      to an Object can help in resolving the 'Frame Problem', which reflects the
      inability to predict with accuracy how conditions may change over time.
      If Tendencies are assigned with realistic probabilities, then the
      state of a system at some time in the future will be more accurately
      predictable than in the absence of such knowledge.  For most problems
      that have been modeled in computer systems, the model has been simplified
      to make it tractable, but to deal with real-world situations, the 
      complexity of reality must be represented in some way.  This category
      of 'Tendency' is one tool with with to do so.
      
      'Tendency' is an AttributeValue, rather than an AttributeType.  Thus the
      tendency ('OrganicDecomposition') of organic tissue that is no longer part of an organism to
      decompose (due to chemical, biochemical, and bactrial processes) would
      be one subtype of 'Tendency'.  It would be an Attribute of tissues,
      and would be one of several AttributeValues that are values for the
      AttributeType 'Stability'.
      
      There is some relation between tendencies and QualitativeAttributes,
       so Tendency subtypes may be deisngated as instances of QualitativeAttributeType,
       and be used wuth the ;'hasQualitativeAttribute' relation, as well as
       the 'hasTendencey' relation.  The implications of either relation should be the same, when 
       a FOL representation is implemented.
      
    BFO Definition: A realizable entity that always or with a significant
      degree of regularity initiates a process or transformation in the independent
      continuant it is a disposition of, under specific circumstances. A general formula 
      for dispositions is: X (object) has the disposition
      D to (transform, initiate a process) R under conditions C.
      
      BFO Examples: the disposition of vegetables to decay when not refrigerated,
       the disposition of a vase to break if dropped, the disposition of blood
       to coagulate, the disposition of a patient with a weakened immune system 
       to contract disease</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A TendencyToDroop is the characteristic Tendency of objects
    that are 'Limp', in that, when held by one edge or end so that that end
    is pointed horizontally, the remainder of the object will curve downward 
    toward the Earth (near the Earth's surface).  Some stiffness of a 'Limp'
    object (such as a piece of paper) may cause the ultimate Earth-pointing droop
    to increase gradually over some distance from the fixed anchor point,
    until it reaches the final direct-downward direction..
       This tendency will depend not only on the substance composition of an
    object, but of its shape and size, and the manner in which it is anchored to
    a fixed holding point; a piece of paper may droop if held out flat by
    one edge, but may not droop at all if curled up..</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="Flexible">
        <rdfs:comment>An attribute of PhysicalObjects specifying
         that they can bend to some extent and do not retain their
          original shape when some force is applied (though they may
          regain their original shape when the force is removed).  This is 
          a general category of attribute which can take several
          degrees.  In Cyc this concept is in effect a PhysicalObject
          that is flexible, but in COSMO the attribute and the object
          are separate concepts.  For the Cyc notion of a flexible object,
          see 'FlexibleObject'.
          
          Flexibility can be a property of substances, but is more appropriately
           assigned to objects, since the degree of bending for any given force
           will depend on the dimensions of an object and where the force
           is applied.  This attribute includes all perceptible degrees of
           flexibility.  A sphere or cube of rigid material such as solid plastic,
           rock, metal, or glass should not be characterixed as flexible in 
           any degree, though they may be 'Compressible'.,
          
          'flexible' can be distinguished by degrees of flexibility:
           (1) 'slightly flexible', meaning that an object such as a metal beam
              or airplane wing, or wooden plank, is relatively rigid, but can
              flex to some extent (perhaps not much more than 10% of its
              length) when some pressure is applied at the point furthest from
              the point where it is fixed to an immovable object.  This property
              is not disjoint with 'Rigid' or 'Stiff'.
           (2) 'bendable'
           (3) 'foldable'
           (4) 'creasable'
          As of version 0.32 not all of these distinctions are included in COSMO,
            and none have been axiomatized.

            collections whose instances are determined _solely_ by the
            physical state they are in - for that, see

            _are_ included in this collection, even though they exist
            solely in one physical state.    The collection #$Water is

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="PhysicalQuantity">
      <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#MeasurableQuantity"/>
      <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#QuantitativeAttributeValue"/>
      <rdfs:comment>A PhysicalQuantity is a measurable quantity that
       has a numerical value qualifying a UnitOfMeasure.  In one
       notation, a mass of 25 grams could be expressed as 
       '{25 grams}' where 'grams' is a function that returns a
       MassMeasure.  PhysicalQuantities are measures of attributes of
       objects in our real world, and as such are subject to
       uncertainty, also called 'measurement error'.  PhysicalQuantity
       has an attribute of 'MeasurementUncertainty', which is an
       optional attribute.  When a MeasurementUncertainty is not
       explicitly provided with an instance of PhysicalQuantity, each
       implementing system has the option to designate default
       uncertainties, which may be general or specific to 
       particular categories of measurement.
       
       COSMO note: PhysicalQuantities in COSMO are categorized both as 
        quantities, and as AttributeValues.  Conceptually, to be viewed as an
        attribute, some combination of AttributeType and AttributeValue would
        both be involved (e.g. 'a length of 30 cm').  But at this point
        (v0.3) it does not appear necessary to represent such quantitative
        attributes in that explicit manner.  This issue remains open for
        possible future elaboration.
      
      SUMO:  A PhysicalQuantity is a measure of some quantifiable aspect 
      of the modeled world, such as 'the earth's diameter' (a constant length)
      and 'the stress in a loaded deformable solid' (a measure of stress, 
      which is a function of three spatial coordinates).  All PhysicalQuantities 
      are either ConstantQuantities or FunctionQuantities.  Instances
      of ConstantQuantity are dependent on a UnitOfMeasure, while
      instances of FunctionQuantity are Functions that map 
      instances of ConstantQuantity to other instances of ConstantQuantity
      (e.g., TimeDependentQuantities are FunctionQuantities). 
      Although the name and definition of PhysicalQuantity is borrowed
      from physics, PhysicalQuantities need not be material.  
      Aside from the dimensions of length, time, velocity, etc., nonphysical 
      dimensions such as currency are also possible. Accordingly, amounts of
      money would be instances of PhysicalQuantity. PhysicalQuantities 
      are distinguished from Numbers by the fact that the former are associated with a dimension of measurement.</rdfs:comment>

     of error from an 'ErrorEllipse'.
     
     There are various ways to express the uncertainty of a measurement.
     A common way is to assume (or know from experience) that the 
     measurements will distribute according to a Gaussian distribution,
     and express the uncertainty as one standard deviation - which 
     means that 66% of the time, measures are within (plus or minus)

         of measurements.  For measurements conforming to a

<owl:Class rdf:ID="UniformRange">
        <rdfs:comment>A UniformRange is a measure that 
         expresses the distance from the mean that 
         a measurement could be.  When measures use
         a UniformRange they may be expressed,
         for example as '10 +/- 1 meter', meaning that
         the measure could fall into the range from 9 to 11 meters.
         
         Though not typically described explicitly, such
         a UniformRange, if it is intended to be interpreted
         in a distributional manner rather than as meaning that the
         measure has equal probability of being found at any point in 
         that range, could function as and be converted
         to a GaussianOneSigma ConfidenceInterval.  For
         example, if a range is given and it implicitly means 
         that there is a 95% probability that the true value will lie
         inside that range, then the cited number could be interpreted as a
         Gaussian two sigma value; if the range is intended to
         mean that 99% of the time the true value will be within
         the cited range, then the cited value could be
         interpreted as a three-sigma value, and converted
         to one-sigma by dividing by three.
         
         If, however the range is not intended to represent
         a Gaussian-like distribution, but merely is a way of
         saying that the true measure must be somewhere within that
         range, conversion to a statistical measure will not
         be possible to do while preserving the meaning of
         the cited range..</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A standard of measurement for some dimension. For example,
           the Meter is a UnitOfMeasure for the dimension of length, as is
           the Inch.  There is no intrinsic property of a UnitOfMeasure
           that makes it primitive or fundamental; rather, a system of 
           units (e.g. SystemeInternationalUnit) defines a set of orthogonal 
           dimensions and assigns units for each.
        
        Cyc: A specialization of #$ScalarDenotingFunction
            (q.v.).  Each instance of #$UnitOfMeasure is a function that
            takes one or two numbers or other #$NumericIntervals as
            arguments, and returns as value a #$MeasurableQuantity
            (q.v.), such as a #$Distance or a #$Speed or a #$Volume.  If
            a unit of measure is applied to one number (see
            #$Number-General) the result is a precise quantity that is a
            #$ScalarPointValue; if applied to two (different) numbers --
            or to one (or two) #$ProperIntervalOnNumberLine(s) -- the
            result is a closed-interval quantity that is a
            #$ScalarProperInterval.  For example, (#$Meter 5) is the
            distance five meters and (#$Meter 5 10) is the distance
            five to ten meters (inclusive) .    (A partial exception to
            the above is the unit-of-measure #$Unity (q.v.), which
            always returns a #$NumericInterval rather than a
            #$MeasurableQuantity.)  Specializations of #$UnitOfMeasure
            grouped by what they measure include #$UnitOfTime,
            #$UnitOfSpeed, and #$UnitOfVolume.  Other specializations
            are #$OneDimensionalUnitOfMeasure,
            #$MultiDimensionalUnitOfMeasure, #$UnitOfMeasureWithPrefix
            and #$UnitOfMeasureNoPrefix.</rdfs:comment>

        Cyc: The collection of syntactically well-formed

            instance of #$TruthFunction (e.g., an instance of

            CycL terms (see #$CycLTerm), with the entire sequence
            enclosed in parentheses.  For example, (#$isa #$Collection

    <rdfs:comment>A CompoundNoun is a Noun composed of two or more individual words, 
    functioning grammatically as a single Noun.  There are three types
    of CompoundNoun: OpenCompoundNoun (dog house, physics book),
    HyphenatedCompoundNoun (ski-boot), and ClosedCompoundNoun (skyscraper).
    Many closed compound nouns started out open, with usage became hyphenated,
    and eventually became closed.  The meanings stayed the same for many 
    of them - but there are cases where adjective-noun combinations can
    occur in both forms, with different meanings, such as:
        blue bird (a bird with bluish color)
        bluebird  (a specific species of bird)
   In those cases, a different emphasis and accent will usually distinguish
   in speaking between the compound noun and the adjective-noun combination.
   
   In the broad sense of 'collocation' (meaning words that are used
   together more frequently that would occur by chance combination),
   a CompoundNoun would be one type of collocation.  (But 'collocation'
   has also been used in the narrower sense of words that are used together
   and related by grammatical function, such as verb-object).</rdfs:comment>

        HRAF (KIN GROUPS - 610). In every society, individuals maintain interpersonal 
        relationships, characterized by particular kinship terms and
         culturally patterned behavior, with each type of relative recognized by the prevailing 
        kinship system.  In addition, an individual is normally affiliated with one or more 
        kin groups, each consisting of some, but not all, of his relatives. By "descent" is meant 
        a cultural rule defining the types of relatives with whom an individual is affiliated in 
        a kin group. It need not, and commonly does not, imply that these relatives are more 
        closely akin to him than are those who do not belong to the same group. The

        Cyc:  (#$lengthOfObject OBJECT LENGTH) means that the
            length of OBJECT is LENGTH.  Which dimension of a given
            object counts as its length partly depends on such things as
            the type of object it is, its shape, and its spatial
            relations to other objects in its environment.  Length is
            normally  measured as the #$Distance from (what one
            intuitively thinks of as) one  end  of the object to its
            other  end , and often corresponds to the dimension of the
            object that has the greatest magnitude.  Some types of
            objects (e.g. trains and yachts) have front and back ends --
            and thus lengths - by virtue of having an intrinsic default
            orientation (see #$FrontAndBackSidedObject and the other
            specializations of #$BilateralObject).  For some other types
            of objects (e.g. shoelaces and hair strands), length is
            determined by that dimension that is of much greater
            magnitude, relatively speaking, than any of the
            object's other dimensions.  Still other objects have
            lengths by virtue of having orientations determined only in
            relation to their environments (e.g. the  length  of a row
            of adjacent buldings might be the distance across the side
            of the row that faces the street, whether or not that
            happens to be the row's dimension of greatest

        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: Height, like Width and Length, may
          depend on orientation.  This relation is restricted to 
          solid objects, and measures the distance from the lowest
          point of the object (in its normal orientation, or in its
          present orientation, depnding on the context) to the top
          of the object.  For some objects, such as mountains, whose
          'bottom' point is not clearly delimited, some convention such
          as 'sea level' may be used for the bottom point.  In such cases,
          it would be better to define a separate subrelation to avoid
          ambiguity.  Also,for objects aboe the ground, the distance of
          the bottom of the object from the ground is not represented by
          this relation.  For liquids, the distance from the
          liquid surface to the supporting surface of the containing object
          is the 'depth'.
          
          NOTE that to represent fields in tables that use a single 
          number to represent height in some units (e.g.in meters),
          use 'hasHeightInMeters', which is not a subproperty of this
          relation because the domain differs. 
          
          NOTE that there is a special subproperty of hasHeight, 
          related to people: 'hasBodyHeight'.  This relation is a
          subproperty of 'hasHeight' and also of 'hasLength', specific
          for people.  This means that the 'height' and 'length' of a person
          are the same thing, when talking about innate properties.
          This convention is adopted because in Russian
          what is in English called a 'height' is called a 'length'.
          If one uses the more general relation 'hasHeight' in place of 
          'hasBodyHeight' for a Person, the interpretation will usually
          be identical, unless the context indicates that the person is
          not standing, and a 'height' different from the stature hieght is
          being measured.

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="Translocation">
      <rdfs:comment>SUMO: Translocation is that class of Motions 
        in which an object moves from one place to another.  In the case of round 
        trips, the origin and destination are the same, but the intervening 
        motion passes through other locations.  Translocation represents linear 
        motion, in contrast to rotation or other movement in place.  A vehicle is 
        not necessary; Ambulating is a kind of Translocation.

       Cyc comment: A subcollection of #$MovementEvent.  Each instance
            of #$Translocation is a movement across a distance; thus
            there is both a location that it is a movement  from  (see
            #$fromLocation) and a location that it is a movement  to
            (see #$toLocation).  (These two locations might or might not
            be distinct, considering round-trips.)  Note that instances
            of #$Translocation might or might not involve a salient
            moving object (see #$objectMoving); for those that do see

            an object (an instance of #$SomethingExisting) moves some

            object's center of mass changes location with respect
            to the relevant frame of reference).  The moving object need
            not move completely out of its original spatial extent; for

            Each instance of #$Translation-SingleTrajectory is a

            #$trajectory-Complete.  One or more items might have the
            role of #$objectMoving in such an event.  Note that although
            there is a single #$trajectory-Complete, it does not follow
            that there is a unique place in the role of #$fromLocation
            or #$toLocation because that depends on our descriptions of
            these locations.  (E.g. the same single-trajectory movement
            can be described as from Texas to Pennsylvania, from Austin
            to Pittsburgh, or from northwest Austin to south
            Pittsburgh.)  However, the single #$trajectory-Complete
            connects one from-location and one to-location.  (Similarly,
            there may be a single existing #$motionPathway-Complete that
            the trajectory goes along, or a single #$Traversal of paths
            indicated by #$traverses-Complete.)  Note that a
            translational motion performed by a whole #$Group is likely
            to be a #$Translation-SingleTrajectory; e.g. a flock of
            birds flying together or a snarl of rush-hour traffic on the
            Beltway.  Non-examples include an opening break in a game of
            billiards and a group of water droplets coming together into
            one big drop. Contrast with #$Translation-MultiTrajectory.</rdfs:comment>

            the destination.  The moving object may be either a
            #$NonFluidlike object (e.g. a baseball) or a

            Another example: a single molecule of water flowing from

            #$LocomotionProcess-Animal), but also locomoting devices
            such as cars, submarines, and airplanes, which are
            controlled either internally or remotely by distinct
            #$Agents, but share significant properties with locomoting
            #$Animals - notably that their trajectories are not just
            functions of forces such as gravity and resistance, but
            rather can have abrupt changes of direction or speed that
            are or appear purposeful. This collection also explicitly
            includes locomoting events in which the
            #$providerOfMotiveForce is a non-agent natural force such as
            gravity, so long as the object moving is or appears to be in
            control of its trajectory of motion. Thus someone downhill
            skiing or hang-gliding would be a positive example.</rdfs:comment>

           nature - but because of the potential for confusion, the
           base COSMO proces is called 'FunctionalProcess'.
           The present category represents moving events, not
           a FunctionalProcess. Name change needed?  This distinction
           among events as continuous or composite is not maintained in

           and is therefore used here in COSMO version 0.3.

    >hasComponentSubstance is used to specify that some particular substance necessarily contains
    within it a component which is another substance.  This is very broad, and can be used to
    specify multiple heterogeneous types of substance components, such as mixtures,
    pure chemicals, or elements.  Thus we can say that blood contains protein, or that
    protein contains nitrogen.
      In addition to substances that are composed of whole molecules, we also
      permit representation of 'Substances' that are parts of molecules, such
      as 'phosphateGroup'.  The latter type of substance will be represented 
      by the Cyc 'MolecularComponent'.
      >> This relation is transitive.  In order to specify a relation that
      points only to some primary component(s) (e.g. a polymer contains a unique
      type of monomer unit), a relation that is not a subrelation of this one must be defined.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>hasMainComponentSubstance is used to specify that some
      particular substance necessarily contains within it a dominant component
      which is another substance.  The 'Main Component' substance pointed to 
      will not necessarily be more than 50% of the total, but it
      will usually be percentage-wise greater than the other Substance
      components, and in rare cases (such as concentrated solutions of
      highly soluble solids) when another substance is of greater
      percentage weight, it should contribute significantly to the
      properties of the whole Substance; this is the case in some
      solutions, where the solvent will be pointed to by this relation,
      even though the solvent will occasionally not be the main
      constituent by weight.
      
      An example of this relation would be to point to Gold as the 
      'main compnent substance' even for 10-karat gold, where the Gold is
      less than 50% of the total weight of the Substance, but 
      is the most salient component in terms of properties.
      
      For the case when a Substance has some significant properties
      that characterize a mixture, but may not necessarily be a
      significant fraction of the weight, the relation
      'hasMainActiveIngredient' should be used.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>hasConstituentSubstance relates physical objects or regions to the substance(s) which
     form some part of the composition of the object or region.  The component substance
     pointed to in this relation does not have to be the main component,
     and the object does not have to have a uniform distribution of substance
     types.  If the component substance does form a larger weight fraction
     than any other substance, the relation 'isComposedMostlyOfSubstance' 
     should be used instead.
    
    One could say that a {shovel hasConstituentSubstance Steel}, even if the
    handle is wooden.  We can use a relation which also specifies the
    actual weight fraction of each substance, but such a relation would
    be ternary, and cannot be directly supported as an OWL 'property'.
    
    NOTE that In Cyc the 'substances' (or stuffs) were represented as 
    objects made of a particular substance.  In COSMO we distinguish the
    object from its composition, and this relation specifies, where it
    makes sense to do so, what the 
    substance compostion of particular objects is.
    
    NOTE that this relation is a subProperty of the generic 'hasPart'
    relation.  The 'hasPart' relation has no implications, and is used only
    as an umbrella to collect all the 'part' relations that may
    ber used in language.  The notion of a substance being a 'part' of
    an object may be the least common use of 'part', but it is
    found, and this subproperty relation allows it to be used in 
    this ontology.</rdfs:comment>

              (2) piled on an open-top container. Things that are contained
              in a container must move in synchronization with the container
              when the container is moved.</rdfs:comment>
         </owl:ObjectProperty>
      </owl:inverseOf>
    <rdfs:comment>contains is a very general relation that specifies
    that some PhysicalObject or PhysicalSubstance.is contained,
    in some way, in the subject entity.  The subject entity
    does not have to be a Container.  For the 'containment'
    relation between AbstractSymbolicObject's (texts, documents,
    strings) use 'containsSymbolicObject' or its inverse
    'isContainedInSymbolicObject'.    
    
    NOTE that a Region of space can also 'contain' something.
    NOTE that this differs from 'isLocatedAt' in that the containment
    relation requires that the thing contained is not a part of
    the containing thing.  Thus one PhysicalObject can contain another 
    PhysicalObject only if the containing PhysicalObject has a cavity of 
    some kind.  This restriction does not hold for the
    general 'isLocatedAt' relation.  However, 'contains' does not
    include Events as either subject or object.  For Events, use
    'occurredAt'.
    
    As a generic 'contains' relation, this relation will also 
     include the 'containment' of Substances by PhysicalObjects.
     The relation on Substances is more properly handled by 
     the specific substance relations 'hasConstituentSubstance' and 
     'containsSubstance'  This 'contains' relation is more generic,
     to accommodate the ambiguous linguistic 'contains' assertion,
     to provide a direct conceptual definition of that notion.

    OBO_REL: 'contains' is similar to this relation, but has some
     differences
    OBO documentation for OBO rel 'contained_in':
    OBO Definition: C contained_in C' if and only if: given any instance 
    c that instantiates C at a time t, there is some c' such that:
    c' instantiates C' at time t and c located_in c' at t, and it is not
    the case that c *overlaps* c' at t. (c' is a conduit or cavity.)
    OBO Comments: Containment obtains in each case between material and 
    immaterial continuants, for instance: lung contained_in thoracic cavity;
    bladder contained_in pelvic cavity. Hence containment is not a 
    transitive relation. If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition
    and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t.
    Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants 
    are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants 
    location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood,
    and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand 
    this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows: 
    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t.
    The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined 
    (see definition above)</rdfs:comment>

<!-- @Desire, @Goal, @Intention -->

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Desire">
    <rdfs:comment>A Desire is MentalObject within a CognitiveAgent
    that is basically emotional, though the emotion of Desire may
    be caused by the conclusion of a rational thinking process.
    A Person may desire a thing (i.e. to possess a thing), or
    some future situation - for something to happen, or some 
    process to occur, or some state to come into existence.
    a spcialization of 'Desire' is a 'Goal', which similarly
    refers to some future situation, but bringing about that
    future situation involves some action on the part of the Agent with the Goal.
    
    Although in language we can say that a person 'desires' an
    object, in COSMO that would be represented as the person
    desiring the 'DesiredFutureSituation' in which that
    person possesses that object, so the desired thing is
    in all cases a Situation, even if an Object is indirectly referenced
    as a participant in that Situation.
    
    NOTE that the restriction on this Type referencfes a 'DesiredFuruteSituation'
    rather than merely a FutureSituation.  This requires that,
    in secifyhing a Desire and the Situaion desired, that Situationj
    should be categorized as a DesiredFutureSituation so that
    it can contian a pointer back to the Agent who wants it,
    and serve as an index of which agents would be pleased to
    see a particular Situation happen.  (Not all agents
    need to be thus referenced, as certain DesiredFutureSituations
    such as the election of some person to an office, may be desired
    by a very large number of people).
    
    NOTE: In SUMO, 'desires' is treated as a relationship between some
    CognitiveAgent and a proposition describing the thing desired,
    and a 'Desire' would be the Proposition that is the
    object of that relation.  But there is another difference.
    The SUMO 'desires' apparently is closer to COSMO 'Goal'
    since it involves participation of the Agent.  The SUMO
    relation is described here for reference, but is not equivalent to
    'Desire' in COSMO.
    SUMO:  (definition of 'desires') '(desires ?AGENT ?FORMULA)' means
    that ?AGENT wants to bring about the state of affairs expressed 
    by ?FORMULA.  Note that there is no implication that what is desired 
    by the agent is not already true.  Note too that desires is distinguished
    from wants only in that the former is a PropositionalAttitude, 
    while wants is an ObjectAttitude.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>An Intention is MentalObject within a CognitiveAgent
     that refers to some future Action that the agent intends
     to participate in, in some capacity.
     
     The representation of this notion is complex in OWL,
     since it involves specifying two related things:
     there is a future Action; and the Agent will
     participate in that Action (of course all Future
     Actions are contingent, but *if* the *specific*
     FutureAction that is referenced occurs, the Agent *will*
     be a participant).
     
     Note that the Agent does not have to desire the 
     FutureAction to occur - the Agent may be *forced* to
     participate, and have an Intention to participate,
     because not to participate would entail some
     undesirable consequences, which might be trivial 
     (disappointing someone) or serious (loss of the Agent's
     life).  This is one disctinciton between an Intention and
     a Goal - a 'Goal' in COSMO references a FutureSituation that the 
     Agent desires to happen - for the Agent's own purposes.
     
     An Agent may have an Intention to participate in some
     FutureAction only because it is an imposed Obligation.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Assignment">
    <rdfs:comment>An Assignment is MentalObject within a CognitiveAgent
     that refers to some Future Action that the agent has
     some form of obligation to do because it was
     assigned to the agent by some Authority.  Unlike
     with a Goal, the Authority in this case cannot be the Agent 
     itself.  An Assignment may or may not coincide with
     a Desire - the FutureAction contempelated in an Assignment
     may be desired by the agent obliged to perform it, but 
     may merely be an imposed Duty.
     
     Note that the Agent does not have to desire the 
     FutureAction to occur - the Agent may be *required* to
     participate, may participate, if at all, only
     because not to participate would entail some
     undesirable consequences, which might be trivial 
     (disappointing someone) or serious (loss of the Agent's
     life).  This is somewhat similar distinction between an
     Intention and a Goal, but an Agent may have an Assignment
     yet have no Intention to perform the Assignment.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="desires">
      <rdfs:comment>desires relates an IntentionalAgent to
       either (1) some future situation that the agent wants
       to happen, or to be (statically), or to persist (if it 
       already exists); or
       (2) some object that the agent wants to possess.
       This relation aggregates desires as situations and objects
       to accommodate the corresponding ambiguous meaning
       of the linguistic 'desire' and 'want'  For the case
       of wanting an object, use the more specific 'wants'.
       
       An Agent may desire that some current situation continue as it is,
       so this relation does not imply that the desired situation
       does not already exist.  In such a case, what would
       be 'desired' is the event in which the current state persists
       for some interval of time into the future.
       
       NOTE that this relation is highly time-sensitive and
       makes sense only when specified at some reference 
       time point.  At present (v0.3) higher-arity
       relations are not represented in COSMO, and this 
       time reference is absent.

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="Goal">
        <rdfs:comment>A Goal is a MentalObject that relates to a Situation that
         an IntelligentAgent desires and intends to make happen by taking some
         action. In COSMO a Goal is a Group of MentalObjects that necessarily 
         includes a Desire - because the Goal referencs something that an Agent wants
         to happen, which is the characteristic of a Desire.  A Goal,
         in addition to the desire to see something happen, includes the 
         intention (expectation) that the Agent her/himself will take some
         action to help make that thing happen.
         
         NOTE that a 'Goal' includes an Intention, but differs from an
         Intention in that the Goal references a situation that the
         Agent desires, whereas an Intention to do something 
         does not necessarily imply that the Agent wants the
         FutureSituaion to happen for the Agent's own purposes.
         
        COSMO note: In OpenCyc a Goal is a subtype of
        '#ELSentence-Assertible' - i.e. an assertion.  Although the Cyc 
        representation of 'Goal' includes many of the intuitions that seem to be contained in 
        the usual meaning of 'Goal', the linguistic usage appears to be closer
        to the notion of the goal being the realization of the actual situation
        that an agent (usually a person) wants to become true; however, the Goal is 
        in the mind of the IntelligentAgent, and is created by the IntelligentAgent,
        but is not a PhysicalObject, threfore is best represented as  MentalObject
        in COSMO, rather than the situation itself.  It necessarily includes 
        some intention, but is not the intention itself.  So the representation
        of a Goal must include each of these elements in relation to each other.
        
        NOTE that a Goal references some desired FutureSituation.  When the 
        FutureSituation has occurred and is no longer in the Future,
        the Goal itself must terminate its
        existence, and the Goal will be located in the past, 
        
        Cyc:  Typically, this attribute characterizes
            relationships holding between Cyc formulas and a particular
            agent when the formula describes a state of affairs that the
            agent intends to take steps to actualize, i.e., when
            actualizing the state of affairs is a goal of the agent.
            However, it might also be seen as an attribute of the
            relationship between the agent and the static situation
            depicted by that cyc formula (see #$StateFn).  This is the
            most general goal attribute and should be used only when one
            is unable to specify more exactly what kind of goal the
            relevant state of affairs is for an agent.
            
         ToDO: axioms must specify that the FutureSituation
         of the Desire and Intention are the same, and that the
         Agent that has the Goal will be a participant in the
         FutureSituaion.</rdfs:comment>

         Cyc: This attribute characterizes goals which are

            agent or group of agents.  The kinds of 'status'

            Correspondingly, the kinds of agents or groups in which one
            can have a 'status' includes organizations,
            geographical regions, professional groups, and peer groups.
            Examples of goals which may be qualified with #$StatusGoal
            include a country's goal of broadening its sphere of

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Mission">
    <rdfs:comment>A Mission is a Goal, to which the IntelligentAgent has a higher level
    of commitment (or determination) than for a common Goal; in addition, the Goal
    needs to have as a beneficiary some purpose other than benefitting the 
    IntelligentAgent itself.  A Mission may include a number of individual Goals,
    a and will be motivated by some sense of duty, which may be self-imposed.
    
        The Random House dictionary defines this sense of Mission as:
        '16.  an assigned or self-imposed duty or task; calling; vocation.'
        
    .  The level of commitment required to make a Goal into a Mission is vague,
    but for this ontology it merely needs to be significantly higher than for a typical
    Goal.  The commitment may be imposed by some authority other than the Agent
    with the Mission, e.g. by an employer or supervisor.  A military 'mission'
    will typically be assigned by someone other than the persons performing 
    the mission.
    
    Having a Mission does not necessarily mean that the IntelligentAgent with the Mission 
    will not benefit from its accomplishment; it merely means that some other
    Agent must also benefit.  Thus a commercial company can have as its 'Mission'
    the total satisfaction of its customers.  That benefits both the company 
    and its customers.
    
    ToDO; axioms must specify the above conditions.</rdfs:comment>

     >In Cyc called 'Organism-Whole'.
    
     An Organism must be a whole individual, composed of one or more cells,
     capable of living independently of other living things (though it may have
     to feed on other living things, even as a parasite).  This cannot be just
     part of an organism, such as a liver removed and fed in a perfusion apparatus.
     An organism can be single-celled, like a bacterium.  An organism must have 
     a cell membrane that separates the internal cytoplasm from the exterior environment
     while it is living and metabolizing.  Therfore a virus is not an organism, but a
     different form of life.
     
     NOTE carefully that in COSMO v0.2 the category 'Organism' by default
     is intended to represent typical living adults forms of an organism,
     but abnormal forms are not actually excluded logically.
     Therefore though we make certain necessary assertions about an
     'Organism' without being concerned about exceptions, the
     results will be true only in the default case and certain
     logical contradictiona may occur.  This is a temporary measure
     until a better way of handling default reasoning is implemented.
     Note, for example, that dead organisms are still categorized
     as Organisms (this is used mostly for People), even though
     an Organism is disjoint with 'InanimateThing' - this is to 
     allow the reasoner to catch unintended mistakes of classification.
     .
     When exceptional circumstances are encountered, one should use the
     category 'ImmatureOrganism' or 'AbnormalOrganism'.  Rather than
     reify such categories for each organism type, they can be generated
     by use of functions on the typical organism Type.  If functions are
     not available in some implementation, reification may be necessary.
     A more accurate solution would be to leave the organisms as generic,
     and create a 'typical adult' subtype to hold the values for the
     prototype.  This requires a quasi-duplicate typical type for each organism,
     which may ultimately be better, but is avoided at the present COSMO
     stage of version 0.2.

    <rdfs:comment>A Proposition is the abstract propositional content
    (i.e. the 'meaning') of some sentence, formula, or combination of
    sentences in any language.  A Proposition is the actual meaning 
    of a sentence or sentences in any language, and is independent of the language and
    of the symbol system used to encode the meaning.  A related collection of
    Propositions is still considered as a Proposition; a prominent example is 
    the body of accepted lore in some FieldOfStudy.
    
    There may be some temptation to use the subtypes of Proposition
    (Assertion, Axiom, Rule) as though they are symbolic objects -
    perhaps AbstractTexts.  In casual conversation this will create no
    problems, and in fact it may not create problems in reasoning
    with the COSMO either, since  both are abstract entities and not 
    PhysicalObjects, and thus not disjoint.  But it will be good practice
    to keep the propositional meanings separate from what are explicit
    though abstract linguistic representations of the meanings,
    wherever the distinction is clear.
    
    NOTE that this abstract notion of Proposition should not be conflated
    with an AbstractText that expresses that Proposition in symbols
    (usually linguistic symbols).  An abstract 'Proposition' is related
    to such a symbolic representation by the relation 'hasAbstractRepresentation'.

     SUMO:  Propositions are Abstract entities that express a complete thought 
     or a set of such thoughts.  As an example, the formula '(instance Yojo Cat)'
     expresses the Proposition that the entity named Yojo is an element of 
     the Class of Cats.  Note that propositions are not restricted to the content 
     expressed by individual sentences of a Language.  They may encompass 
     the content expressed by theories, books, and even whole libraries.
     It is important to distinguish Propositions from the ContentBearingObjects
     that express them.  A Proposition is a piece of information, e.g. that
     the cat is on the mat, but a ContentBearingObject is an Object that
     represents this information. A Proposition is an abstraction that may have
     multiple representations: strings, sounds, icons, etc.  For example,
     the Proposition that the cat is on the mat is represented here as a string
     of graphical characters displayed on a monitor and/or printed on paper,
     but it can be represented by a sequence of sounds or by some non-latin alphabet 
     or by some cryptographic form.

   OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002\n A collection of intangible individuals. Each instance
    of #$Proposition is an abstract propositional thing that has some truth value 
    in some context or world. A proposition is assumed to be representable 
    (at least in principle) by a sentence in some formal or natural language. But 
    it should _not_ be assumed that propositions are themselves intrinsically 
    linguistic items in the way that sentences or formulae are. Indeed, propositions
    are often viewed as extra-linguistic, intensional entities that (while not
    sentences themselves) are represented or expressed by meaningful sentences 
    (or, on some versions of this view, by concrete tokens of sentences). On such
    a view it is possible for distinct sentences (either from the same language 
    or from different languages) to express the very same proposition; 
    e.g. 'Snow is white', 'White is the color of snow', 'Schnee ist weiss'. 
    (in German), and (arguably) '(#$relationAllInstance #$objectHasColor #$SnowMob #$WhiteColor)' (in CycL).
    Similarly, it is sometimes the case that a single sentence - when used in different contexts - 
    will express distinct propositions; e.g. 'I am hungry.' said by you and said by me. Most formal 
    languages (such as a first-order predicate calculus) and natural languages (such as English) 
    include the resources for composing expressions that represent propositions from component expressions (that might or might not themselves represent other propositions).\n\nDOLCE: The abstract content of a proposition.

      be false.  The degree of certainty which people attach to 
      various statements of fact varies on a continuous scale, and
      it is probably not possible to distinguish some opinions that
      a person has some doubt about from what they 'believe'.  Also, people may 
      say they 'believe' one thing, but act as though they don't
      consider it true.
      
      One function of representing a Belief (as contrasted with an assertion
      that a person may make) is to allow representing a Lie (an assertion contrary to an
      Agent's belief), and to provide one componenent of motivation
      for an Agent to act.
      
      NOTE that although a Belief, like other MentalObjects, may have a

             those who have only nominal but not actual adherence to a faith.  As of 
             COSMO version 0.45, this distinction has not been added to the class
             hierarchy - no parent 'nominal' type is defined.  This may best be 
             approached by creating a 'nominal' function.</rdfs:comment>

            COSMO: various definitions of Religion have been
            proposed.  For COSMO the esential core of a religion is a set
            of beliefs that attribute at least some of the events
            in this world to beings or forces other than physical
            processes that are susceptible at least in theory to 
            reproducible experimental or observation confirmation.
            A belief system that considers people (or other living things) to
            have a soul that is more than the manifestation of physical 
            processes in the body would be a religion by this definition.
            NOTE that a religion does not hae to believe in one or more
            gods.
            Other definitions:
            
            a system of beliefs usually involving the worship of supernatural
            forces or beings.
            
            a set of ideas, beliefs, practices, rituals, etc. through which a 
            people relates to supernatural powers-- whether those powers are 
            impersonal 'forces', spirits, or 'gods.'
            
            a framework of beliefs relating to supernatural or superhuman 
            beings or forces that transcend the everyday material world.
            
            the codification of values, beliefs and behaviors in a society 
            with a transcendent element; Theology is 'ideology' with recourse to 
            the supernatural. Religion can be manifested as a type of ideology, 
            forms the basis of group identity, is associated with 'code' books,
            is practiced in localized populations, contributes to ideas of social justice,
            can be mobilized in support of political violence, and is useful 
            in negotiation and peacemaking efforts.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Rule">
    <rdfs:comment>A Rule is a special kind of Proposition  that
      asserts that some agent has some Obligation to do (or refrain from
      doing) some act.  This is not a logical 'rule', which is categorized 
      in the type 'Axiom'.
      
      NOTE that as a subtype of Proposition, this 'Rule' type 
      represents the conceptual content, not the abstract symbolic
      things (AbstractTexts) that describe the Rule, nor the
      physical texts on which the Rule may be visibly written.
      
      Every Rule specifies what is desired or mandatory for some
      future situation, and carries the expectation that agents
      who conform to the Rule will make that Situation happen.
      The definition of Rule subsumes simple games as well
      as complicated laws and business rules.  The future
      situations may be processes, events, or states.
      
      Thus the Rule 'stop for a red light' refers to the situation
      where a vehicle approaches an intersection with a traffic
      light that is red; - to conform to the Rule, the vehicle must perform
      the event of stopping before the location of the light.
      That event of stopping is the desired situation that the Rule specifies.
      
      Although Rules are created to be applied to Agents, it
      is difficult in many cases to specify the agents to whom the
      rules are intended to apply, as the agents may be in
      some cases only vaguely defined by membership in a class -
      for example, game rules only apply to those playing the game
      at some particular time.  Laws may apply to anyone
      'within the jurisdiction'.</rdfs:comment>

     <rdfs:comment>NOTE: this is a physical object located on the surface of a planet,
      which contains mostly water, but will also include a part of the
      land which serves as container for the water; thus it is a subtype of
      'ContainerAndContents'.  This is not a region or area, but it can serve (as can
      other physical objects) as a location.  Certain bodies of water can be 'located at'
      themselves, when they occupy a named region, such as a river.
      Every physical BodyOfWater should specify the region in which it is located, which 
     may have the same name. For logical clarity, we distinguish regions
     of geographic space containing water from the water itself, though in 
     ordinary speech the distinction may not be made, and may not
     in specific cases be important.  Where the object itself may be
     most significant is in cases where one discusses the composition
     of the water, e.g. salinity, polllution, etc.
     
     For spatial regions coinciding with bodies of water, use 'WaterRegion'.

     The most common kinds of Designators are names of people and places, but many other kinds of 
     Designators exist, in particular Identifiers that are numbers or
     have a numerical component.  Every word in a language, natural or artificial,

    >An Identifier is a specialization of Designator in that it refers to
    a particular individual entity.  This contrasts with the more general
    Designators, which can refer to classes of entities, such as the Designator 
    'cat', referring to a species of animal.  Identifiers do not have to be unique;
    for example, many human names are used as identifiers for more than one person.
    But when the Identifier is created (and as a SymbolicObject, it must be created 
    with a purpose by some intelligent agent), it is intended to refer to an individual entity.

    A complication exists in that the may be many different linguistic variants
    of a particular Designator or Identifier.  Names may be pronounced in various 
    ways by different people, or transliterated into different alphabets.  Thus 
    the designator itself may have an abstract representation as any of various other
    SymbolicObjects, such as text strings in different languages.   We use the convention 
    that the designator itself is  fixed as the SymbolicObject created by the agent
    (person) who created it to use it as a label for an entity, and there may be different 
    ways of linguistically expressing that designator.  An AbstractString (in any language)
    used to represent a Designator will be related to that Designator by 
    the hasAbstractRepresentation relation.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A PhysicalLabel is a physical artifact that is a
     SymbolicObject, and is created with the intention of designating the identity
     or some quality of a PhysicalObject to which it is affixed.  The PhysicalLabel
     may be stamped onto the labeled object (such as the serial number of 
     a pistol, or the VIN on some part of an automobile), or may be a metal tag or
     paper tag attached by glue or cement to the object, or may be a separate tag
     that is affixed to the labeled object with a string or wire. This Type corresponds
     with the physical label sense of the English word 'label', and is distinct
     from the abstract sense used when one says, for example, that a word 'labels' a
     concept.
     
       A PhysicalLabel does not have to be an identifier of an individual object, such as
     a serial number tag; it can also be a tag providing information about the nature of
     the object (or its contents, if it is affixed to a container).  A label saying
     'FLAMMABLE' or "BIOHAZARD', or a graphical symbol having either of those meanings
     would be a PhysicalLabel in this sense.  In contrast, the abstract symbol for 'BIOHAZARD"
     (a stylized representation of a four-unit cluster of a coccoid bacterium) would be an 
     abstract label, and a physical tag with a representation of that symbol would be a 
     corresponding PhysicalLabel.</rdfs:comment>

    >A UnaryFunction that maps a number to the corresponding calendar Year.  For example, (YearFn 1912) returns the Class containing just one instance, the year of 1912.  As might be expected, positive integers return years in the Common Era, while negative integers return years in B.C.E.  Note that this function returns a Class as a value.  The reason for this is that the related functions, viz. MonthFn, DayFn, HourFn, MinuteFn, and SecondFn, are used to generate both specific TimeIntervals and recurrent intervals, and the only way to do this is to make the domains and ranges of these functions classes rather than individuals.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Virus is a life form that, in one stage if its
         life cycle, may consists simply of  DNA or RNA coated by protein,
         or, in more complex forms, may have a membrane and some enzymes. 
         But the memberane is lost when the virus infects a cell and multiplies, 
         so that membrane does not serve as a cell membrane, and even the complex 
         viruses are not organisms for this classification.
         In Cyc, a Virus is an organism, but in COSMO it is not.
         NOTE that a Virus is an Object, and the proper interpretationshould be
         a single virus particle.  A Group of virus particles
         could also be considered as a Group object, but that has not
         yet (v0.32) been represented in COSMO.

            viral DNA or RNA, which then uses cellular mechanisms to
            create new viruses.  Viruses cause many diseases in all

            necessarily include things that are ingested but not
            metabolized, such as the stones that birds swallow to aid in
            digestion, or dirt, paint chips, and coins ingested by
            children. The function #$EdibleByFn is used to specify the

      The remainder of this comment is From the USDA site:
              http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/cotton.html
      Four species of the genus Gossypium are known as cotton, which is grown primarily
       for the seed hairs that are made into textiles. Cotton is predominant as a 
       textile fiber because the mature dry hairs twist in such a way that fine,
       strong threads can be spun from them. Other products, such as cottonseed oil,
       cake, and cotton linters are byproducts of fiber production.

      Cotton, a perennial plant cultivated as an annual, is grown in the United States mostly 
       in areas from Virginia southward and westward to California, in an area often referred 
       to as the Cotton Belt (McGregor, 1976).

      Taxonomy of Cotton
      The genus Gossypium, a member of the Malvaceae, consists of 39 species, four of which
       are generally cultivated (Fryxell, 1984). The most commonly cultivated species, 
       G. hirsutum L., is the subject of this EA. Other cultivated species are G. arboreum L.,
       G. barbadense L., and G. herbaceum L.

      Four species of Gossypium occur in the United States (Fryxell, 1979; Kartesz and Kartesz, 1980).
       Gossypium hirsutum is the primary cultivated cotton. Gossypium barbadense is also cultivated.
       The other two species, G. thurberi Todaro and G. tomentosum Nuttall ex Seemann,
       are wild plants of Arizona and Hawaii, respectively. Gossypium tomentosum is known from
       a few strand locations very close to the ocean.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Substance derived from the stalk of the Flax
           Plant, in a process of soaking in water called 'Retting'.
        
        In Retting 'the flax fiber is loosened from the outside woody stalk.
        This is accomplished through several methods taking from a few days 
        to several months, depending upon the quality of linen desired.
        Linen is composed of 70 to 85 percent cellulose, but the remainder
        is natural impurities.'

          <rdfs:comment>Taste is an attribute TYPE that can apply to many substances,
          not only to food. Physiologically, Taste should be considered as 
          a property of substances.  But linguistically and intuitively, it may
          also be viewed as a property of objects, such as a particular piece of pie.
          We therefore permit taste to be assigned as an attribute of either physical
          objects or physical substances.
          
          As with other AttributeTypes, this Type is best related to the AttributeValues 
          associated with each AttributeType by a ternary relation such as 
          {TheEmpireStateBuilding has Height {1024 feet}}.
          In OWL, however, the relation, which must be binary, is more complicated.  
          For accommodating the limitations of OWL, for each AttributeType ATT 
          we define a relation 'hasATT' which is binary and points to some value 
          which is a subclass of one or more associated AttributeValue Types </rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Food is a collective term denoting any substance that is eaten
        by animals for nourishment, or can be eaten for nourishment.
        NOTE that Food is a subtype of 'EdibleStuff' which has been redefined
        from the Cyc meaning to exclude liquids, and include only
        organic materials.
        
        'Food' in COSMO is a substance, not a PhysicalObject.
        For the PhysicalObjects that consist of Food substances,
        see 'FoodObject'.
        
        Cyc comment:  An instance of #$ExistingStuffType, and a
            specialization of #$FoodOrDrink.  Each instance of #$Food is
            a particular portion of food of a type which can be, and
            habitually is, eaten by humans or other animals.  Here the
            notion of _eating_ is important; eating an instance of
            #$Food will generally require biting or chewing, but if
            placed into the mouth (e.g. with a utensil) in a manner not
            considered to be drinking, it is still considered eating.
            Thus, edible stuff normally taken in via drinking,
            inhalation, or osmosis is excluded from this collection.  A
            borderline example is a bowl of bouillon, which, although it
            can be drunk from the bowl is normally ''eaten''
            with a spoon; a borderline non-example is a very thick
            milkshake, which may be eaten with a spoon, but is normally
            drunk (possibly using a straw) from a glass.  Instances of
            #$Food provide calories and/or nutrients that humans or
            animals need.</rdfs:comment>

    This attribute is optional, as one may want to refer
    to substances without being specific about the concentration.  But
    when it is important to specify the concentration (or the percent
    composition in a mixture - see 'hasPercentComposition'), this attribute
    should be defined.  Each time a concentration or percent composition
    is defined, this creates a new Substance, and a new subclass of 
    Substance needs to be defined.</rdfs:comment>

      >hasLocation points to a measure that specifies the location
       (typically Latitude and Longitude) for a PhysicalObject.
       
       This might be a subproperty of 'isLocatedAt', but that
       relation has different argument types and is transitive.
       
       A rule could specify the relation thus:
       (iff
         (and
           (isLocatedAt ?PO ?Loc)
           (isanInstanceOf ?PO PhysicalObject)
           (isanInstanceOf ?Loc LocationMeasureType))
         (hasLocation ?PO ?Loc)).
         
         Since a LocationMeasure cannot be the first argument of the 
         isLocatedAt relation (it is not an Object), the transitivity cannot continue
         beyond the point where a LocationMeasureType is referenced.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A #$MountableTransporter is a transporter that one

            This collection was originally created to enable the
            following sorts of natural language interpretations.  Anyone
            who is said to 'ride' such an object is most likely to
            be the #$driverActor.  If someone 'rides' a non
            #$MountableTransporter (e.g. a train) is most likely not a
            #$driverActor but a #$passengers.  Positive exemplars
            include horses, jet skis, motorcycles, bicycles.  Negative
            exemplars include cars, trains, planes.  A borderline
            positive example is a skateboard.  When one 'rides' a
            skateboard one is most likely the #$driverActor, but, unlike
            typical #$MountableTransporters, one is also most likely not sitting.</rdfs:comment>

      multiple subevents that are TransporationEvents, and
      each TransportationEvent must use only one TransportationDevice,
      in this particualr relation.
      
      In the case where, for example, a container ship 
      carries many containers, and each container is a
      TransportationDevice, the transport via one container
      will be one TransportationEvent if referenced by this relation.
      The composite Event in which multiple containers are shipped on
      one vessel will also be an individual TransportationEvent,
      and the Event of transporting all of those containers can 
      be specified by the use of this relation, pointing to 
      the vessel on which they were transported.
      
      Thus, the placing of an object in a container starts
      one TransportationEvent, using that container.  Placing
      that container in another container, or on a
      TransportationDevice, starts another TransportationEvent.
      Such container-in-container events can be nested indefinitely.</rdfs:comment>

          A specialization of #$PhysicalEvent.  Each
            instance of #$SeasonOfYear is an event characterized by
            specific meteorological or climatic conditions that occurs

            Notable specializations are #$WinterSeason, #$SpringSeason,
            #$SummerSeason, and #$FallSeason.
            
            SUMO: SeasonOfYear is the class of four seasons correlated with
            the calendar Year and associated with changes in the length of
            daylight and with overall temperature changes. Depending upon the
            GeographicArea, a SeasonOfYear may also be associated with 
            weather patterns (e.g., rainy, dry, windy). The characteristics
            of seasons (cold vs. hot temperatures, long vs. short days) are reversed from
            the NorthernHemisphere to the SouthernHemisphere.</rdfs:comment>

    >A RigidObject is a SolidObject that will not distort its shape greater
      than 10% in the vertical dimension when supported by three or four
      sharply pointed  rigid objects, placed at the periphery of the 
      RigidObject, in the Earth's gravitational field.   This will exclude 
      most semi-solid gels.  Long beams may fail this test, though the same 
      beam in a shorter length (having to support less mass in the middle) may
      pass the test.  Thus rigidity is a property of objects, not of materials,
      and depends not only on the inherent hardness of a material, but its shape
      and size.  A thin sheet of a material will not be rigid though a beam of
      the same material can be.</rdfs:comment>

    >A SupportingObject is an ArtifactObject that was designed to serve as
     a support, to hold something in a particular place in a gravitational
     field.  This is a very broad category, including chairs, lamp posts,
     and various platforms.  IT also includes supports that
     are part of a path, such as a ladder.  But it does not include
     floors or other integral parts of structures, or flexible supports such
     as a rope stretched across two supporting anchors, or a hammock
     stretched etween two trees.
    
     The categories will usually be classified by what the SupportingObject
     is designed to support.  A chair, for example, is designed to
     support one person while sitting.</rdfs:comment>

            _primary_ function.  For example, a car is a single purpose
            device because it has the primary function of providing
            transportation.  Of course, a car can provide shelter as
            well as transportation; but a convertible with a badly torn
            roof still functions as a car (because its primary function
            is transportation) even though it does not function as much
            of a shelter.  It is also possible for a
            #$SinglePurposeDevice to have other functions associated
            with it, even though they are not functions of that device
            per se.  For example, if a car has a cigarette lighter, a
            clock, etc., those parts have their own functions, which are
            performed in the car and enjoyed by the users of the car
            while they are using the car.  However, the functions of
            those devices (lighting cigarettes and telling time) are
            generally not considered to be the functions of the car
            itself.  If someone utters the sentence 'Fred used his car
            today' we would guess that Fred drove/rode somewhere in
            the car, and would be surprised/amused/annoyed/confused if
            we later discover that the speaker meant only that Fred used
            the car's lighter and the clock but didn't travel
            somewhere by car.</rdfs:comment>

     ''The New Jersey Performing Arts Center
        By Lovet Obakpolor
        Newark's commitment to the arts is reflected in the New Jersey
     Performing Arts Center, the city's largest cultural center. 
     This 12-acre site, on the Newark riverfront between Military Park 
     and McCarter Highway, offers an intimate 514-seat theater and 
     a 2,750-seat hall where international celebrities and New Jersey's 
     finest performers shine. NJPAC has gained national attention, 
     serving as a model for its programming, audience, diversity and 
     education leadership. It has also played an integral role in returning 
     nightlife to the state's largest city.
        NJPAC provides a certain uniqueness that no other performing arts center
     has offered. Diversity of its audience members and performers is evident
     at the center. One in four of all ticketholders represents minority 
     communities, including 17 percent African American. NJPAC thrives as 
     a different kind of cultural center that integrates both traditional
     and nontraditional audiences.'' . . . 
     ''After a decade of planning and a $187 million capital campaign, 
     NJPAC held its world premiere on Oct. 18, 1997. It debuted to great 
     fanfare and acclaim. Since then, residents of New Jersey and people 
     from all over the world continue to visit the performing arts center. 
     In its first season, 500,000 patrons visited NJPAC. Former President
     Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore visited NJPAC. 
     Former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman held her inauguration
     at NJPAC, the first gubernatorial inauguration to be held outside 
     of Trenton since 1932.''</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="SpaceInAHOC">
        <rdfs:comment>A SpaceInAHOC is a PhysicalObject that comprises
          the whole or part of a structure in which people may live, do business,
          or perform any other activity that people can do indoors.
          As a 'Cavity' this means that there is room to contain
          things - objects, people, etc.
          
          There is a certain ambiguity in this Cyc concept: as a 'feature'
          a Cavity should not be identical to a whole object, but
          a 'HumanOccupationConstruct' can be a whole structure as
          well as a part.  In COSMO We retain this ambiguity and interpret
          this category as including whole structures as well as
          parts of structures.  The emphasis is on the space
          inside the structure, but this category is *not* a region of
          space, it is a PhysicalObject.
        
        Cyc: A specialization of both #$Cavity and
            #$HumanOccupationConstruct.  Each instance of #$SpaceInAHOC

            major spaces inside any #$HumanOccupationConstruct,
            including not only rooms (instances of
            #$RoomInAConstruction), but also halls, elevator shafts,
            attics, stairwells, and the spaces inside trains, cars, and
            airplanes that are designed for human occupation.  Other
            building parts which are not open spatial regions (e.g.,
            walls, plumbing, etc.) are _not_ included in this

        cyc:  a specialization of

            #$FloorInAConstruction is a physical floor in a building
            (typically made to walk upon), _not_ the level (the story
            composed of rooms or halls - see #$LevelOfAConstruction).
            The floor can include any floor in a building such as the
            floor of a room on the third floor as well as the floor of
            the entire first level of the building.  This includes just
            the horizontal surface - not the subfloor.  It also does
            not include floor coverings like carpet or tile.
            
            SUMO: A StationaryArtifact that is the bottom surface 
              of a Room.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="MusicalInstrument">
        <rdfs:comment>A collection of physical devices.  An instance of
            #$MusicalInstrument is a device that  (in the standard case)
            is designed to be manipulated by a person to generate music
            - that is, s/he successively plays the notes of the music
            by manipulating the instrument during the playing.  Possibly
            the player also supplies by muscle power the force that
            produces the sound, but possibly it uses another power
            source (e.g., electricity, or steam).   The music may or may
            not be of his or her own composition, but the player's
            actions determine that the notes are produced by the
            instrument (in the standard sense).    Note:  If the
            directive role of the human player is subsumed by the device
            - as it is, e.g., by some electronic instruments which are
            programmable and/or pre-programmed to produce music or
            musical sounds - the device loses some of its
            instrument-like quality, and some automated uses may be
            abnormal cases of 'playing' an instrument.  An older
            but analogous example is: player pianos.  If the device is
            pre-programmed so that humans can't direct the music at
            all, then the device is not a musical instrument (but a
            musical device) - for example, music boxes.  Also excluded
            from #$MusicalInstrument are devices which produce music 'at
            random' (such as wind chimes).  Devices such as radios,
            tape decks, CD players, which are used to play wholly
            pre-recorded or otherwise other-controlled music, are also
            not included in this collection.
            
            SUMO: A Device which is manipulated by a Human 
             and whose purpose is to produce Music.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="System">
    <rdfs:comment>A System consist of a group of two or more physical objects that
       are designed (by people or evolution) to work together to perform 
       some function, plus the AttributeValues attached to those objects,
       and the relations among those objects - the attributes and relations
       are component elements of the Group, thus distinguishing a System from 
       a simple group of Objects..  There is therefore some significant relation
       between any Object in a System and some other Object in the System.
       The System is an aggregate consisting not only of  the Objects, but also 
       of the relations between them.  This is the basic Entity that participates 
       in Situations.
       
       NOTE: In Cyc something as simple as a shield or TurtleShell can qualify as
       a 'System' so the requirement for two objects may need to be taken
       liberally: a shield needs a handle, so that can qualify as the second
       'object'.  Usually a System has several distinct Objects that interact
       in some way beyond merely being attached to each other.
       
       @@ToDo: Although this generic notion of System is not a PhysicalObject, it
       can have PhysicalObjects as subypes and instances.  The PhysicalObject
       instances will have a group of objects identical to the ObjectGroup that is related
       to the System by the 'containsObjects' relation.
       This seems to violate the notion of the System as containing the
       relations, and may not be logically coherent, but as of v0.39
       it is not clear that this will cause any problems, and is a
       convenience fudge, to be reconsidered.  This is in a way reminiscent of
       Cyc's CompositeTangibleAndIntangible category, but judiciously used.
       Possibly the relations should be considered not as a part of the
       System, but an attribute, and that could avoid any logical problems.For later.
       
       Because a System is more than just the Objects it contains (it includes
       the relations), it is not represented an ObjectGroup, but
       is related to the Objects it contains by the 'containsObjects'
       relation.  Formally, the relations among the objects are part
       of the system but at this point it is not clear that attempting
       to represent those relations generically will be useful.  Perhaps
       that will be useful at a future point.
       
       Note that a System, whether artifactual or natural, must have
       a DesignFunction.  If the System is broken, diseased, or malfunctioning it
       may not be able to perform that function, but will still retain
       its identity as a System because the identity arises from the
       purpose (human or evolutionary) for which the System was created.</rdfs:comment>

            full ownership of OBJECT. Thus, AGENT enjoys #$FullUseRights
            (q.v.) over OBJECT.  OBJECT might be  a physical artifact, a
            parcel of land, an animal, a piece of  intellectual property
            , or anything else that can be owned.  Note that, although
            ownership often involves control, #$owns is _not_ a
            specialization of  #$controls, as there are many exceptions.
            For example, when the owner of  a building leases it to
            someone, the former gives up almost all control  over the
            buiding for the term of the lease.</rdfs:comment>

        Cyc comment:  Assets are economic resources (things of value)

            NOTE that hasAssets is a subproperty of 'owns' and therefore must 
            point to something fully owned by the agent.  If a LegalAgent has only
            a part ownership in something, that part ownership must be

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="Compressible">
        <rdfs:comment>Compressible is the quality of objects and solid substances
         that permits objects to become narrower in width, in the direction of
         a line between two other objects that are exerting a force on the 
         compressible object.  The deformation will be mostly or completely
         reversed when the force is removed, and this reversible quality makes
         this attribute more specific than 'deformable'.
         
         This differs from 'flexible' in that a flexible object may not
         be compressible, and the quality of 'Flexible' is usually applied to 
         objects that are long relative to their girth, whereas 'Compressible'
         is mostly applied to objects that are not much longer than they
         are wide.  A long couch cushion would perhaps be among the longest objects
         that would be characterized as 'Compressible'
         
         NOTE:  all solid objects compress to some extent; 'compressible' has 
         the common-sense meaning that an object can compress noticeably (to a person) 
         when a force that a person can easily apply (less than 50 pounds, with a hand)
         is pressed against the object.  This is a quality that is usually attributed to
         objects that are not very long relative to their girth.  Examples are sponges,
         some kinds of cake, cork, inflated rubber balls, inflated auto tires, 
         foam pillows and cushions.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="TherapeuticProcess">
     <rdfs:comment>A purposeful Event performed on the body of
     an animal for the ultimate goal of improving the health state of 
      an animal. This is more general than
      in SUMO, as it includes some diagnostic procedures and cosmetic
      procedures, all presumably done as part of the actions needed
      to create some improvement in the health state of an animal, as
      perceived by the person doing the treatment (for non-human animals
      or unconscious people), or by the person requesting the
      procedure.  One type of MedicalCareEvent that is not included
      here is a laboratory test on a sample from a patient.
      
      NOTE: improving the health state can be interpreted as merely
       improving the state of comfort, as 'Massaging' is classified
       as a subtype of this Type in SUMO.
       
      SUMO: A Process that is carried out 
       for the purpose of curing, improving or reducing the pain associated 
       with a DiseaseOrSyndrome.
       
       In Cyc called both 'TreatmentProcedure' and
       'MedicalTreatmentEvent' appear to be similar to
       the SUMO 'TherapeuticProcess', so all are merged
       here in this Type.

        <rdfs:comment>The collection of all temporal things, including

            adopted by any culture that has them, and thus can
            distinguish one culture or set of cultures from another.
              
            NOTE: A CulturalThing does not have to be unique to a single culture, but
              to serve as a distinguishing feature, it should not be common to 
              a majority of the cultures defined in the ontology.
              
           Some examples of 'CulturalThing' (From Otis Military Cultural Terms):
           'Cultures have symbols that provide non-language in-group communication.
            This includes:  body marking, wearing of symbolic art, fetishes, colors,
            geometric design, ground markings, and  use of television and media for
            communication of in-group religious beliefs and practices are known.
            Poetry seems especially important as it is shorthand for other forms
            of written communication. Music is a powerful symbol of religious practice 
            and carries messages far and above the actual words, rhythm, instrumentation,
            or tune.'</rdfs:comment>

 <owl:Class rdf:ID="Culture">
        <rdfs:comment>A very broad concept: the sum of the beliefs and practices

          the style of living of some human group. See also 'Subculture' and
          'CulturalThing'.
          
         The definition for the sociological sense is adopted from the Random House
            Webster:
         RHW: (Anthropology) the sum total of ways of living built up by a group of human beings 
             and transmitted from one generation to another.
             
         For COSMO, this includes not merely groups focused on some geographical area,
          but also groups who adopt sets of beliefs and practices for a particular
          purpose; therefore 'scientific culture' would be a specialization of this
          sense and could describe the ways scientists behave *as scientists*.
          An individual may participate in more than one culture.
          
          NOTE that subgroups of a particular Culture may have their own
           subculture, such as 'TeenageCulture'.
           
         In the Yale HRAF, the term 'TOTAL CULTURE' appears to be used as the base
         category for comments about 'Culture', and is described thus:
         (TOTAL_CULTURE, code 180): Summary statements on the total culture as analyzed,
         interpreted, or described. The '180' categories are intended to include 
         descriptive and interpretive materials which pertain to the entire
         culture or which override a number of more specific categories. Consequently 
         much of the material pertinent to the individual topics below will be

        <rdfs:comment>The notion of a 'request' involves both the event
         in which a Request communication is made and the content 
         of that communication.  The content of a request can be 
         interpreted as a combination of assertion and question:
         the assertion is that some information or action is desired, and
         the question is whether the listener will provide the information
         or do the action.
         
         This Type represents the request event.  The content of the request
         is represented as 'RequestContent'.  This request is generic,
         including computer communications to other computers.
         For the specifically human activity, use
         'Requesting'.
        
        Cyc: An illocutionary force associated with requests.
            If a communication act has this illocutionary force it is
            the speaker's intention to ask the listener to perform
            the action(s) described in his/her utterance.  If the
            listener responds positively, s/he places him/herself under
            an obligation to do the indicated action.  'Speaker'

    In Cyc called 'Communicating':
       Cyc: A specialization of #$PurposefulAction and
            characterized by one or more #$InformationTransferEvent
            sub-events.  Each instance of #$Communicating is an event in
            which the transfer of information between or among agents is
            a focal action; communicating is the main purpose and/or
            goal in the event.  That may be contrasted with events which
            involve communication but wherein the focus is different,
            e.g., playing cards (wherein the progressive actions - and
            winning - of the game are focal).  Since #$Communicating is
            a specialization of #$PurposefulAction, each #$Communicating
            event must be intentional on the part of the
            #$communicatorOfInfo; it may or may not be intentional on
            the part of the agent playing the #$infoCommunicatedTo role.
            Hence, a speaker on a soapbox haranguing an indifferent
            crowd is performing an instance of #$Communicating.  In
            contrast, Juliet soliloquizing on her balcony, unaware that
            Romeo is listening to her, is not #$Communicating; rather
            Romeo (and Juliet, unaware) are engaged in an
            #$Eavesdropping. Communicating may be either a one-way or a
            two-way transfer of information (cf.
            #$CommunicationAct-Single, #$MultiDirectionalCommunication).
            Every event belonging to #$Communicating contains at least
            one transfer of information between at least two agents who
            participate in the event.  (Note that the latter requirement
            excludes reading and writing from #$Communicating, when
            those events are just the private accessing or generating of
            information.)  Communicating may be specialized in various
            ways, such as, by the method or medium used (e.g.,
            #$AudioCommunicating, #$NonVerbalCommunicating,
            #$FaceToFacePresenceCommunicating); by the type of
            information involved (e.g., #$MakingAnAgreement); by the
            purpose of the communication (e.g., #$Teaching,
            #$Negotiating); by the agents involved (e.g.,
            #$IntraOrganizationCommunication, #$StageProduction).
            Examples of #$Communicating include a symphony performance,
            an email message, a telephone call, a speech, a handshake,
            issuing a traffic ticket - all of which normally, and
            focally, involve communication between two or more agents.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A PhysicalFeature is either a part of a PhysicalObject,
    or some hole, cavity, or path through an object that has some 
    spatial shape and can reasonably be referred to as something having 
    some kind of identity.  It is parasitic on the PhysicalObject that 
    gives it its identity, and therefore has the character of a
    Role.  It is possible in some cases, like a handle, to be an Object 
    that has had a separate identity at manufacture time, but is always viewed in its
    role as being or intended to be part of another object. 
    Holes in Objects or bumps on objects are common Features that
    are not simply identifiable as traditional parts of objects.
    
    Features also include parts that are colored differently from other
    parts of an object: a tatoo on a person's skin is a PhysicalFeature.
    Also included are parts that are attached or embedded, such as the hair on
    an animal, or the absence of hair in certain parts (e.g. a bald patch at the 
    crown of the head).

            flattened, uncrumpled, unfurled, etc., has one dimension

            a _continuous_ sheet, it may be penetrable, so

            (but not in a deep pothole) or an instance of
            #$AltoStratusCloud would be instances of this collection.
            Note that being an instance of #$SheetOfSomeStuff implies
            nothing about the current configuration of the instance; in
            particular, instances of #$SheetOfSomeStuff need not be
            perpetually lying flat.  For example, aluminum foil on a

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="LogicalFunction">
    <rdfs:comment>Called just 'Function' in SUMO, but in
     COSMO that term is reserved for funitons that are actions performed
     by artifacts or naturally evolved biological systems.
     
     SUMO (Function) ; Function-Denotational (Cyc)
    A Function in COSMO is used to create new terms (instances or classes) from 
     combinations of other terms.  This is somewhat analogous to the use in mathematics 
     and computers,.    This notion is not directly supported in OWL, but the Functions are represented in all variant notations of the COSMO, so that they can be translated into notations where functions can be used, and used in that form.

   SUMO: A Function is a term-forming Relation that 
   maps from a n-tuple of arguments to a range and that associates this 
   n-tuple with at most one range element.  Note that the range is a SetOrClass, 
   and each element of the range is an instance of the SetOrClass.

   OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002\n#$Function-Denotational is the collection of functions
    the CycL expressions for which can be used to form non-atomic terms (NATs).
    Specifically, when such a function-denoting expression is appropriately combined 
    with other expressions (i.e. the former is in the 0th argument position and the latter are of the correct number and type) the resulting expression is a new CycL term - a NAT - that may then freely appear as a component in other CycL expressions. The NAT will itself denote the value (if any) of the function denoted by the former expression for the sequence of arguments denoted, respectively, by the latter expressions. For example, #$GovernmentFn is a unary denotational function, and so the CycL constant '#$GovernmentFn' requires one (syntactic) argument (such as the constant '#$France') to form a NAT (in this case, the expression '(#$GovernmentFn #$France)'). This NAT, which denotes the government of France, can in turn serve as a (syntactic) argument in any CycL expression in which (a term for) an instance of #$RegionalGovernment can occur. Alternatively, we could have created a specific new term 'GovernmentOfFrance', asserted that its denotation is an instance of #$RegionalGovernment, and so on. But two related advantages to having NATs in CycL are that they (i) allow for a drastic reduction in the total number of constant terms needed in the CycL vocabulary and (ii) provide a convenient and systematic way to form appropriate new terms as needed out of existing vocabulary (which terms can then inherit from various existing rules and other assertions involving the terms' component expressions). &amp;lt;PARAGRAPH&amp;gt; Important subcollections of #$Function-Denotational include #$IndividualDenotingFunction (whose instances always return instances of #$Individual), #$CollectionDenotingFunction, #$SetDenotingFunction, and #$FunctionDenotingFunction (which is itself a subcollection of the first). NATs formed using terms that denote instances of #$FunctionDenotingFunction often denote instances of #$Function-Denotational themselves. Thus, like most other things, denotational functions can be denoted in CycL either by constants (e.g. '#$GovernmentFn') or - although this is less common - by NATs (e.g. '(#$FunctionToArg 2 #$biologicalMother)'). Note that the collection #$Function-Denotational does _not_ include all functions whatsoever. Functions that, given their natures and the nature of the CycL language, could not sensibly be denoted by any NAT-forming CycL expression are not denotational functions. Examples include certain provably-existing exotic mathematical functions, such as (probably) any one-to-one function from the positive integers to the rational numbers. (For a more general collection that does include such functions, and for a more general explication of the notion of function itself, see #$Function-MathematicalObject and its comment). Note also that #$Function-Denotational does not include any of the so-called #$TruthFunctions (q.v.): #$Predicates, #$Quantifiers, or #$LogicalConnectives. For these relations (as construed in CycL) are not really functions at all, even though it can be heuristically useful to think of them as if they were functions from sequences of arguments to truth values.</rdfs:comment>

      >Similar to  DOLCE:   agentive-physical-object
       Intelligence in the sense used here requires the ability to understand language
       and communicate in a language at least close to the complexity of human language.
       This category includes only physical objects.  At present, the level of intelligence 
       required to belong to this category and be a physical object is possessed only by people.  
       In the future, robots may qualify.  Note that an 'Organization' is also intelligent in 
       the sense used here, but is not a PhysicalObject, therefore does not fall into this category.
  
      DOLCE:  Within Physical objects, a special place have those to which we ascribe 
      generic intentionality (compatibly to Brentano's distinction, the ability to internally
      represent a description). These are called Agentive, as opposite to Non-agentive. In general,
      we assume that agentive objects are constituted by non-agentive objects: an organism is 
      constituted by bodily organs, a robot is constituted by some machinery, and so on. 
      Among non-agentive physical objects we have for example houses, bodily organs, pieces of wood,
      etc. Generic agentivity is defined here in a wide sense as implying representation or conception 
      (to be characterized in a dedicated - but not developed as yet - ontology of mind). 
      A representation or conception only requires intentionality in Brentano's terms 
      (i.e., the ability to represent something to oneself). See also 'rational physical object'.</rdfs:comment>

    >Person(Cyc) Human(SUMO)
   Person is a member of the species Homo Sapiens, and is a synonym of 'Human Being'. 
   As with other categories, this general Type includes all variants, in all contexts,
   so a fetus is a Person, a dead person is a Person, a fictional person is a Person,
   and a hypothetical but not yet conceived person is also a Person.  The type of Person 
   one is dealing with depends on the context.  We typically want to deal with living 
   persons, and that category is provided for convenience as
   the subType 'LivingPerson'.  There is, however, no restriction on
   whether a Person or LivingPerson exists in the real world or in some
   fictional or hypothetical world; that distinction is left to the
   context to disambiguate.
   
   Allowing a dead Person to be a Person and also requiring that a Person
   is a PhysicalObject with mass presents a problem.  Where is the mass of
   a dead Person?  To allow this representation, we will permit a person
   to have 'remains', which would be the physical object that 'is' the Person.
   The 'remains' do not have to be an identifiable corpse, but can be the 
   trace matter of a person's body, even if too dispersed to be recognizable 
   as a Person's remains (e.g. ashes). A dead Person may 'be located'
   wherever its remains are, which could be widely dispersed; however, it is
   unlikely that the 'location' of a dead person will ever be an
   issue other than when the corpse is in a known grave; it is mentioned
   here only to provide a clear understanding of the intended meaning. 
   Only a LivingPerson or a Corpse are compact physical objects that are Persons.
   'Skeletal remains' may be dispered, and will not necessarily
   be compact objects.
   
   NOTE that in COSMO, when importing assertions created outside
   of a COSMO-aware system, it is permitted for default reasoning purposes
   to use the generic type of Organisms as meaning the typical **adult**,
   and specify attributes for the instances accordingly.  If in some
   application or context it is necessary to deal with abnormal variants
   of an organism whether immature, diseased, or otherwise impaired, the categories
   'ImmatureOrganism' or 'AbnormalOrganism' can be used.  If one needs to
   make provision for abnormal (or dead) organisms, the default mechanisms must be used 
   with extreme care.  The subtype of 'LivingPerson' should be considered,
   though that category still includes fictional and hypothetical persons..

    OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
     The collection of all human beings. Something is an instance of #$Person
     just in case it is a member of the species Homo Sapiens, and thus #$Person 
     is an instance of #$BiologicalSpecies in the #$BiologyMt. Persons are the most
     intelligent kind of #$Primate, and the only kind known to be naturally capable

     however, included in the collection #$LegalAgent.

          the text should be a significant part of the purpose of creating
          the object, not just an incidental identification mark or
          graffiti.  If an Object is not originally textual (e.g. blank paper),

          the text, and the main function of the object then becomes
          to hold that text, that object become textual material after the text
          is added.  A building wall with elaborate graffiti is not 
          textual material, though the physical material of the

        COSMO note:  This is a physical text, so it is

         Cyc:  A specialization of #$InformationBearingThing

            significant part of whose informational  content is both (i)
            encoded in some #$CommunicationConvention (q.v.),  usually a
            #$Language, and (ii) represented or displayed in a spatial
            format.  Examples include a copy of a newspaper printed in
            English using  the Roman alphabet, a copy of a book printed
            in English using Braille,  and a poster written in Chinese
            characters.  Condition (i) excludes things like hardcopies
            of drawings, while condition (ii) excludes things like
            magnetic tapes containing recorded speech.  A piece of
            textual material  always involves one or more
            spatially-localized representations - usually  physical
            inscriptions (see #$CharacterStringToken-Inscribed) - of
            #$CharacterStrings (q.v.).  Textual materials are usually
            tangible objects  (such as the examples given above), but

       <rdfs:comment>An Event in which possession of something (an object, right,

           The exchange can be one-way, such as giving a gift, and does not necessarily
           involve reciprocation.  For reciprocal exchanges see 'Transaction'.
           
           NOTE: change of 'possession' does not necessarily imply change
           of ownership, as indicated by the SUMO comment.  A 'Sharing'
           is in COSMO also a 'ChangeOfPossession'.  In Cyc ChangeOfPossession is
           cooperatgeive, whereas in SUMO a Stealing woud also
           be a ChangeOfPossession. So there are at least two 
           differences.  COSMO uises the Cyc interpretation:
           cooperative, not necessarily change of ownership.

<owl:Class rdf:ID="IBTGeneration">
        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of #$InformationTransferEvent and
            of #$Action.  Each instance of #$IBTGeneration is an event
            which creates some #$InformationBearingThing.  The
            #$InformationBearingThing created may be either a transient
            wave phenomenon (e.g. sound, light, or radio waves), or it
            may be a relatively long-lasting instance of
            #$InformationBearingObject (cf. the important specialization
            of IBTGeneration - #$IBOCreation).  Humans frequently
            generate such IBTs as spoken language, gestures, and
            handwritten notes.  It is irrelevant for instances of
            #$IBTGeneration whether there is another agent who accesses
            the resulting IBT.  Note that every communication act starts
            with an instance of #$IBTGeneration.  (Thus, see also
            #$Communicating and its specializations, especially
            #$CommunicationAct-Single.) For an analogous collection
            regarding instances of #$ConceptualWork, see #$CWCreation.
            Two important specializations of this collection are
            #$IBTGeneration-Original and #$IBTGeneration-Replication.
            See also the predicate #$ibtGenerated.
                        
            NOTE that IBTGeneration is not a subtype of
            'MakingSomething' because that latter category must result
            in the creation of some persistent physical object, and IBTGeneration
            could result only in creating gestures or sound waves
            which dissipate quickly.  For
            the event of making a physical IBT see 'IBOCreation'.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="SystemCondition">
        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of #$Situation.  Each instance of
            #$SystemCondition is a state or process undergone by some
            natural or artificial system (for example, an organism or a
            computer network).  The state or process in question may be
            either normal or abnormal.  A typical instance of
            #$SystemCondition is a state or process that has important
            temporal aspects, or  affects the system's condition
            for a significant period of time, such that the condition
            may be thought of as an 'episode' in the existence of
            the system, or even a permanent aspect of the system.
            
            COSMO note: this Cyc category is interpreted as a
            PersistentState, meaning that the situation
            stays constant over some period of time.  If the
            condition is some process (rotating), then the 
            process should be constant over that interval,
            e.g. the rate of turn should be constant, within
            the limits of interest to the ontologist.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="AilmentCondition">
        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: the terms ailment, illness, disease,
            and sickness are considered as logical synonyms in COSMO.
            Although the usage of each varies, it is difficult to distinguish
            any differences in meaning.  In the Random House Webster,
            definition 1 of 'disease' states:
            
            Disease 1. a disordered or incorrectly functioning organ, part,
            structure, or system of the body resulting from the effect of
            genetic or developmental errors, infection, poisons, nutritional
            deficiency or imbalance, toxicity, or unfavorable environmental factors;
            illness; sickness; ailment.
            
            NOTE: that breaks of bones or other trauma is not
            included in this concept.
            
            NOTE: that this is a PersistentState, which is a type of
            Event that has a beginning and ending time.  Although
            a PersistentState can be defined with an arbitrary
            beginning and ending time, the usual interpretation
            of the linguistic terms associated with illness
            will either refer to the whole event from onset to 
            disapppearance of the illness, or to the DiseaseProcess
            that produces the illness during that interval of time.
            This may not conform exactly to the Cyc interpretation, below.
            In COSMO, the DiseaseProcess that produces an
            AilmentCondition is different from though intimately 
            related to the AilmentCondition. NOTE the restriction:
            Every Ailment has a corresponding ProcessType, being
            a PhysiologicalConditionType.
            
            NOTE also that an AilmentCondition is not the same as
            the symptoms of that condition. The symptoms are a 
            separate but related logical category.
            
            NOTE also that not every abnormal physiological condition
            is an AilmentCondition. Arrhythmia, for example,
            may be clinically insignificant or innocuous.
            
            NOTE also that a single instance of a disease
            is confined to one organism, so a Disease
            'isLocatedAt' only one particular organism.  To specify 
            that a group of organisms is suffering from a
            disease, or that an epidemic is occurring among
            some group of organisms use 'DiseaseGroup'.           
            
            Cyc: The most general collection of ailment events; a
            subcollection of both #$PhysiologicalCondition and
            #$DysfunctionalCondition.  An instance of #$AilmentCondition
            is a dynamic state of sickness, injury, or physiological
            impairment.  The rationale for construing ailments in this
            way is the obvious fact that to have an ailment is to
            undergo an event: an individual ailment has temporal
            features, it progresses dynamically, and so on.  It is not
            just a matter of being in some static state of  unwellness .
            Subcollections of #$AilmentCondition include
            #$RespiratoryAilment, #$HeartCondition, #$Cancer,
            #$MotionSickness, #$Poisoning, #$Infection, and
            #$InjuryCondition.  If a particular person has an infection,
            that event is an instance of #$AilmentCondition.  An
            #$AilmentCondition does not begin before there is an actual,
            developed sickness or impairment, and thus does not include
            the event of getting sick or becoming impaired.  Also note
            that each type of ailment, such as #$Infection, is the
            collection of all  cases  or  instances  of individuals
            suffering from that condition.  See also #$DiseaseType.</rdfs:comment>

   OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
   A specialization of both #$HumanAccessibleIBO and #$Artifact. Each instance
   of #$ArtObject is a tangible object that is a work, or a reproduction 
   of a work, in one of the representational or plastic arts, such as 
   a painting, sculpture, ceramic piece, quilt, or stained glass composition.
   #$ArtObject does _not_ include as instances plays, movies, music,
   performance art, or other activities. #$ArtObject is a specialization 
   of #$InformationBearingObject, but its instances need not have any 
   propositional content. Examples of #$ArtObject: the #$StatueOfLiberty,
   the Mona Lisa, a poster reproduction of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night', Rodin's 'Burghers of Calais', a piece of Ju ware from the Sung Dynasty, the windows of Chartres Cathedral, a series of prints by Picasso.

   SUMO: (ArtWork)  Artifacts that are created primarily for aesthetic appreciation. 
   Note that this Class does not include most examples of architecture, which 
   belong under StationaryArtifact.</rdfs:comment>

            non-loop-cycles (if there are any) in SYS are determined by
            the directions of links in SYS.  When designing a particular

            an instance of #$Semi-DirectedPathSystem (#$isa SYS1
            #$Semi-DirectedPathSystem)). One can then create a constant
            for each node (such as Node1) in the system, and a constant
            for each link (such as LinkA) in the system (using (#$isa
            LinkA #$Path-Simple)), and then assert the directions of
            links using #$linkFromToInSystem (e.g.,
            (#$linkFromToInSystem LinkA Node1 Node2 SYS1)).  The axioms

            assertions, such as those involving #$pointOnPath,
            #$linkBetweenInSystem, #$nodeInSystem, and #$linkInSystem.
            One can then proceed creating loops, isolated points, and

    <rdfs:comment>COSMO: the term 'Type' in COSMO is used to refer to those intensionally-defined 
      groupings called:

      Class in       Ontolingua and Protege; 
      Class in       RDF and OWL; 
      Class in       SUMO; 
      Collection in  OpenCyc; 
      Universal in   DOLCE;
      Property in    Ontology Works' IODE system 
      
    * The Type 'Type' in COSMO is intended to be equivalent to the types (classes)
       by those names in those other ontologies.   
    * (isaSubtypeOf A B) means that Type A is a subtype of Type B and that all 
       instance of Type A are also instances of Type B.  

      However, the interpretation of these categories is not universally agreed on.  In 
      the case of ISO15926, the 'classes' of that ontology are intended to be interpreted as
      sets.  The COSMO 'Type' is not a mathematical set.  Among other problems with that 
      interpretation is the fact that any two sets with identical members are considered
      as the same set.  But in COSMO, any number of different Types may have the
      same instances in some particular context.  The same issue is discussed in the SUMO
      documentation of 'Class'. below.
      
      In COSMO, a 'Type' is considered to be a 'Description' which is a group of
      necessary and/or sufficient conditions for some individual entity to be
      an instance of that Type.  The Description can be applied to individual contexts
      (time, location, theoretical or hypothetical contexts) to identify the
      individuals in that context that are instances of the Type.  Therefore,
      a subtype is not a subset of the parent Type and an 'instance' of a
      Type is not a 'member' of some set identical to the Type.  Of course, one may
      define a mathematical Set whose members are identical to the instances of
      a Type in some particular context, but insofar as the instances may vary with context, 
      any Set corresponding to the instances may vary with context, whereas the Type
      (i.e. the description of the conditions for 'instanceship') will be the same
      Type in all contexts.  The necessary conditions for instanceship inherit
      *down* the chain of subtypes, whereas the sufficient conditions for membership
      'inherit' (in a sense) *up* the chain of ancestor Types.
      
      In spite of this difference in logical interpretation, when inference is
      performed, the subtypes and instances of COSMO behave logically exactly the same
      as the classes and instances of the ontologies above - the subtypes
      inherit properties from the parent types and instances of a subtype are
      also instances of the parent Types.  The explicit difference in interpretation is 
      largely a result of the emphasis in COSMO on the need for very explicit 
      specification of the context in which an assertion is made.

     SUMO:  Classes differ from Sets in three important respects. First, Classes are 
      not assumed to be extensional.  That is, distinct Classes might well have exactly 
      the same instances.  Second, Classes typically have an associated 'condition' 
      that determines the instances of the Class.  So, for example, the condition 
      'human' determines the Class of Humans.  Note that some Classes might satisfy
      their own condition (e.g., the Class of Abstract things is Abstract) and
      hence be instances of themselves.  Third, the instances of a class may occur
      only once within the class, i.e. a class cannot contain duplicate instances.

     OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002: The collection of all Cyc collections. Cyc collections are natural kinds or classes, as opposed to mathematical sets; their instances have some common attribute(s). Each Cyc collection is like a set in so far as it may have elements, subsets, and supersets, and may not have parts or spatial or temporal properties. Sets, however, differ from collections in that a mathematical set may be an arbitrary set of things which have nothing in common (see #$Set-Mathematical). In contrast, the instances of a collection will all have in common some feature(s), some 'intensional' qualities. In addition, two instances of #$Collection can be co-extensional (i.e., have all the same instances) without being identical, whereas if two arbitrary sets had the same elements, they would be considered equal. As with any Cyc constant, an instance of #$Collection should be created only if it is expected to have some purpose or utility. Moreover, the 'best' collections to create are the ones which are impossible to define precisely, yet about which there are rules and other things to say. E.g., 'WhiteCat' is not a good element of #$Collection to create, because it's easy to define with other Cyc concepts, and there's not much to say about the collection of white cats; but 'WhiteCollarWorker' could be a good instance of #$Collection, because it is hard to define exactly, yet there are many things to say about it.</rdfs:comment>

       of terms in data structures, representing a structured system of concepts
       that constitute a theory of something.  The difference between an ontology
       and a general notion of some field is the precise definition of the meanings
       of the relations between the component parts of the ontology.  An ontology
       includes (1) a set of Types arranged in an inheritance hierarchy;
       (2) individual things that are instances of those Types;
       (3) formal Relations specifying how the Types are related to each other, how instances
       of Types may be related to each other, and what Types and instances may be related by
       which formal Relations; (4) logical rules that provide more detailed descriptions
       of the meanings of the types and relations; (5)a subclass of rules that specifically
       restrict the usage of relations ('restrictions').
       
       In one sense, an Ontology may be is a BeliefSystem for whatever Agent
       actually considers the Ontology close enough to reality to be worth using
       for practical purposes.  But not every Ontology is such a BeliefSystem,
       so we do not create the formal link to 'BeliefSystem' at this point.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A Theory is a specification describing a structure of some system,
     abstract or concrete.  Theories (e.g. scientific) that describe concrete (physical) systems
     are usually created to explain some observed phenomenon.  Theories that
     describe abstract (e.g. mathematical) systems may be created for any
     reason, sometimes just for the joy of describing an new and interesting 
     structure of abstract elments.
     
     NOTE that a Theory is a subtype of 'Information-Content' in COSMO because
     although a theory may not be exoerimentally verified, it contains 
     propositions that reflect the experience of its creator.
     
     A Theory will be a context in which certain assertions may be true,
     though the same assertions may not be true in other theories, or indeed
     may not be true anywhere other than in that particular theory.  Theories 
     may form a subsumption lattice, in which some theories have
     multiple subtheories.  Every ontology (including this one) is
     a theory - most ontologies are intended to represent some

        <rdfs:comment>An #$AnimalBodyPartType and a specialization of
            both #$ExternalAnatomicalPart and #$AnimalBodyPart.
            #$Appendage-AnimalBodyPart is the collection of all
            appendages of #$Animals.  An appendage is a body part that
            is connected to,  and extends from, an animal's #$Torso
            (or from another of the animal's appendages,  such as a
            hand extending from an arm).  Each appendage is used by the
            #$Animal  for one or more functions.  Altogether, appendages
            serve a wide variety of  functions, including locomotion,
            manipulation, sensing, fighting, scratching,  heat
            dissipation, and balance.  Note that appendages are not
            crucial for the  life of the animal; thus a
            #$Neck-AnimalBodyPart or #$Head-AnimalBodyPart is  not
            considered to be an appendage.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: In COSMO, an Organization differs from its representation in
    most other ontologies.  In COSMO, and Organization is not a group of people, it is a
    MentalObject, an artifact created by people.  the essence of an Organization is that
    it is organized. It therefore must have an explicit set of organizing
    principles (a charter or constitution) whether that is written or, as in
    some small informal organizations, merely retained in the minds of its members.
    In addition to its charter, an Organization will have one or more lists of
    associated agents (people or other organizations).  There may be more than one
    list, and the 'members' may not be called members.  A complex organization
    like a corporation may have several lists, e.g. board members, stockholders,
    corporate officers, employees, even long-term contractors.  The relationships
    of the agents on those lists to the organization and to each other is
    specified in the charter.  Any or all of the lists of associated agents
    ('members' in simple organizations) may be empty.  An Organization can exist
    without members, and this differs from the specification in SUMO (below).
    
    Because an Organization in COSMO is not a physical object, the parts of Cyc or
    other ontologies that consider Organization as a subtype of group of 
    people (a physical object) will be inconsistent.  Some effort will be
    needed to convert Organizations in other ontolgoies to those in COSMO.
    
    When an Organization is said to act as an 'Agent', there necessarily must be
    some physical agent (person or computer program) that in fact performs the
    action.  Thus the 'agency' of an organization differs from that of
    physical agents, as it will be indirect.
    
    Every Organization is an 'Authority' because it creates rules, at least
    for its own members with respect to the organization.
    
    SUMO: An Organization is a corporate or similar institution.
    The members of an Organization typically have a common purpose or function.
    Note that this class also covers divisions, departments, etc. of organizations.
    For example, both the Shell Corporation and the accounting department at Shell would
    both be instances of Organization. Note too that the existence of an
    Organization is dependent on the existence of at least one member 
    (since Organization is a subclass of Collection). Accordingly, in cases 
    of purely legal organizations, a fictitious member should be assumed.


     OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
     The collection of all organizations. Each instance of #$Organization is a group
     whose group-members are instances of #$IntelligentAgent. In each instance 
     of #$Organization, certain relationships and obligations exist between the 
     members of the organization, or between the organization and its members. 
     Instances of #$Organization include both informal and legally constituted 
     organizations. Each instance of #$Organization can undertake projects, enter 
     into agreements, own property, and do other tasks characteristic of agents;
     consequently, #$Organization is a specialization of the collection #$Agent. 
     Notable specializations of #$Organization include #$LegalGovernmentOrganization, 
     #$CommercialOrganization, and #$GeopoliticalEntity.

        <rdfs:comment>A Charter is an AbstractDocument specifying the set of

          In this general sense, a Charter does not have to be issued by a

          sense 2 in The Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary:

          characteristic that distinguishes an Organization from other
          groups of agents.  In COSMO this logical restriction is not

       This relation is a quasi-inverse of 'hasAssociatedGroupType', but is not
       in fact an inverse, as it is an instance-level relation, whereas the 
       former relates an instance of Organization to a Type of Group that it is associated
       with.  The lack of symmetry reflects the need to carefully handle the
       conflated concepts and relations that are involved in thinking about and
       reasoning about Organizations.  A Group may be associated with more than one

        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: An Argument in COSMO is an Assertion or
          Group of Assertions that the speaker believes provides a justification
          for believing some fact(s).  This Type is represented as an Assertion
          (a subtype of Proposition). In ordinary linguistic use the word 'argument'
          often refers to the linguistic phrases used, but since in COSMO eery
          logical 'Argument' impies a linguistic representation, these two
          aspects (propositional content and linguistic representation of the content)
          can be considered as alternative views that can be interchangeably
          used in many circumstances.   It is hard to disentangle the two
          forms in this case.
          
          An additional nuance for 'Argument' is that it is always
            directed at an audience of one or more listeners (the audience can
            be the speaker).  Therefore the linguistic representation of 
            an Argument is an instance of a Communication.

    >A SoftwareAgent is a ComputerProgram designed to function as an Agent,
     i.e. to perform functions and make decisions beyond routine local processing,
     without being directed specifically to do such functions by the program user.
     As with other kinds of Agents, there is a continuum of independence that creates a borderline category between traditional programs ans programs that act as Agents.  At a minimum, an Agent must be able to make decisions that depend on data that was not in the computer at the start of the program, i.e., the functions of the SoftwareAgent must depend on access to local or remote  sensor data or to data that was acquired, e.g. over a network, after the program was initiated by the user.

     Because a program with this level of independent decision-making can 
     be viewed as having 'intentions', it is classified here as a subtype
     of 'IntentionalAgent'.  However, it is not necessarily an
     IntelligentAgent, since a SoftwareAgent does not necessarily have the
     ability to understand language.</rdfs:comment>

            This is the collection of geometrical points that have a
            fixed location with respect to some coordinate system or
            frame of reference.  An important specialization is
            #$SpacePoint-Empirical (q.v.), whose instances have fixed
            locations with respect to some coordinate system or frame of
            reference in the empirically-observable universe, and thus
            are embedded in time.  An example of a space-point _not_ in
            the empirical universe is a point in some abstract Euclidean
            space of the sort studied in geometry.
            Space points can be used to indicate the locations (or
            partial locations) of things in space (see
            #$locatedAtPoint-Spatial).  For example, at the initial
            instant of the 20th Century (in Greenwich, England) the
            center of mass of the solar system was located at some
            #$SpacePoint-Empirical (which is a different
            #$SpacePoint-Empirical than the one at which the center of
            mass is located at this moment).  Considered diachronically
            (as in the foregoing example), 'the center of mass of the
            solar system' refers to a certain #$GeometricalPoint
            but not a #$SpacePoint.

        the 'surface' of the Earth at zero elevation, that may
        be defined, and used as reference for geographical locations and altitudes above sea level.
        
        The standard geoid now in most common use is WGS84:
        (from Wikipedia) WGS 84 is the World Geodetic System of 1984. It is the reference frame
          used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and is defined by the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
          Agency (NGA) (formerly the National Imagery and Mapping Agency) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency).
          WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including
          its GPS "broadcast" and "precise" orbits. WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite
          surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) 
          beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using
          GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS 84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with
          the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994.
          At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS 84 was redefined again and was 
          more closely aligned with International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) Terrestrial Reference Frame 
          (ITRF) 94. It is now formally called WGS 84 (G873). WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame
          for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997. (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84 )

          The WGS84 datum, which is almost identical to the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only 
          world referencing system in place today. WGS84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored
          in recreational and commercial GPS units.</rdfs:comment>

           GeographicalPoint is a location which is a point on the
           surface of the Earth (land or water), which will have a measure expressed as
           Latitude and Longitude, and has an altitude of zero relative to the
           standard geoid (datum) representing the Earth's surface.  It is
           therefore located on the geodetic datum.  This differs from Cyc usage.

            such regions, but they have no breadth or depth (and thus

            region, then each edge of that object (see
            #$EdgeOnObject-Generic) occupies a space-line in that
            region.  Note that space-lines need not be straight.  See

            #$BaseballInning is a subevent of some instance of
            #$BaseballGame (q.v.), or of some attempt to complete an
            instance of #$BaseballGame.  In Major League Baseball a
            complete baseball game consists of nine innings, unless it
            is extended due to a tie score after the ninth, or shortened
            (1) because the home team needs none of its half of the
            ninth inning or only a fraction of it, or (2) because the
            umpire calls the game. (Note that National Association
            leagues may adopt a rule providing that one or both games of
            a doubleheader shall be seven innings in length. In such
            games, any of these rules applying to the ninth inning shall
            apply to the seventh inning.). If a game is called, it is a
            regulation game: (1) If five innings have been completed;
            (2) If the home team has scored more runs in four or four
            and a fraction half innings than the visiting team has
            scored in five completed half innings; (3) If the home team
            scores one or more runs in its half of the fifth inning to
            tie the score. (d) If each team has the same number of runs
            when the game ends, the umpire shall declare it a  Tie Game.
            (e) If a game is called before it has become a regulation
            game, the umpire shall declare it  No Game.   Each instance
            of #$BaseballInning consists of at least two instances of
            #$HalfInning (q.v). During each #$BaseballInning, each
            #$BaseballTeam takes its turn trying to score baseball runs.
            A team's turn during an inning is called a
            #$HalfInning.  By tradition, between the two half innings of
            the seventh inning of a game, there occurs an instance of
            #$MassOrganizedStretch performed by the members of the
            game's audience.

    An organization may have no affiliates called 'members' (who is a 'member'

    This category will be useful for reasoning about the members of an Organization, as 
    contrasted with the Organization itself (consider the average
    age of the memberhip versus the age of the Organization).  It is disjoint with
    Organization, which is a MentalObject.
    
    NOTE that as a 'Group' no instance of 'OrganizationMembership' can exist unless
      it has at least one member.  To cover the case where an Organization may
      have no members at some particular time, a List can be created that
      has designators for the same individuals that are in the OrganizationMembership.
      If no members exist, the instance of OrganizationMembership will not exist,
      but the list can still exist, being empty.  Alternatively if the membership
      roster can include 'former members' one such may serve to satisfy this

COSMO note:  An InstantaneousEvent is a change that occurs instantaneously - the change can be said to occur at one point in time: a system has a set of attributes that are effective at that point in time, , and at any point prior to that, the state may be different in one or more ways.  For physical events, this is unrealistic but can be a useful abstraction.  Certain social or mental events can be said to be instantaneous, such as a change in title or position that is scheduled ahead of time.
  In ISO15926 and some situation calculus representations, processes are simply a series of instantaneous changes followed by periods ('State') of no change.  So this is an important concept for some process representations.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A PureSubstance is a physical substance that is 100% of
        the nominal constituent.  This rarely occurs in the real world, but 
        it may be useful to represent the properties of a pure substance, as
        these can be determined to within satisfactory accuracy by measurements
        on nearly pure substances, or by extrapolation.
        
        The properties of a 'PureSubstance' can also be applied to the
        functional properties of certain substance, such as enzymes, 
        which are typically measured in solutions which may be complex.
        The scientist making such measurements makes a judgement that
        the measured property represents the properties of the pure
        substance, and that will be the recorded property until
        different informaiton is obtained.  The 'turnover rate' of an
        enzyme, for example, may be recorded as a property of the
        'PureSubstance' which is the enzyme.
        
        
        Cyc comment:  A collection of tangible stuffs. Each instance of
            #$PureSubstance is a chemically pure portion of stuff
            belonging to some particular #$ChemicalSubstanceType (e.g.
            #$Water or #$Cellulose). 'Chemically pure' applies to a
            piece of stuff which has no sub-portions that fail to
            conform to the chemical composition of its (single)
            #$ChemicalSubstanceType. In typical contexts, most common
            portions of a #$ChemicalSubstanceType will not be instances
            of #$PureSubstance . For example, a piece of pencil lead,
            though mostly carbon, will not be an instance since it is
            not pure carbon and any portion of ordinary tap water will
            contain too many impurities. Many sub-portions of either a
            piece of pencil lead or portion of tap water will fail to
            conform to the chemical composition of either carbon or
            water. Some instances of #$ChemicalSubstanceType are
            subcollections of #$PureSubstance in most contexts but not
            in all. In typical domestic contexts, for example, a piece
            of ordinary distilled water would be an instance of
            #$PureSubstance . However, in a clean room or microchip
            manufacturing context, ordinary distilled water would
            probably be considerd impure (see #$ImpureCompound). In
            general, to refer to a pure instance of a substance one can
            use the function #$PureFn, e.g. (#$PureFn #$Carbon). Note
            that #$PureFn has #$PureSubstance as a #$resultGenl . Since
            this kind of purity is relative to specified chemical
            composition only, #$PureSubstance (and #$PureFn) does not
            pertain to mixtures in Cyc (such as #$Air). Cf. #$Mixture,
            #$ChemicalSubstanceType. See also #$PureSubstanceType and #$ImpureCompound.</rdfs:comment>

    >A MentalObject is an Object that does not have mass and was created by a Person.  Abstract texts, musical compositions, propositions, theories, plays, poems, speeches - all are MentalObjects.  They will invariably have a physical representation in some PhysicalObject (including brains, light waves and sound waves).  But the MentalObject itself has no physical (material) component.    This corresponds closely to what in some systems (e.g. the Ontology Works top ontology) is called an 'AbstractArtifact' - something created by a  Person that is not a PhysicalObject.

  We adopt the convention that an individual MentalObject exists only so long as there 
  is some PhysicalObject that represents it.  That PhysicalObject could be the brain 
  of a Person, some sound or electromagnetic waves encoding that MentalObject, or 
  some piece of paper with markings on it.  When the last physical object representing 
  that MentalObject ceases to exist, that MentalObject also ceases to exist.  A new
  MentalObject indistinguishable from a previously existing one can always be created 
  (even by the original creator), but it would be a different individual with a 
  different identity.

    <rdfs:comment>HumanRole is the root category for people who are
    referenced in some particular role - professional, or by the Role they play
    in some Event.
    
    For many HumanRoles, people occupy that role only for some interval of
    time, therefore the participation in a Role must be time-indexed
    in some way.  One method used in COSMO is to use the relation
    'isServingInTheRoleOf'.  This is an assertion that in itself carries
    no time-indexing, therefore would have to be used in an assertion
    that was reified and related to the valid time period by
    one of the 'holds' relations.  Another method is to 
    attach to each distinguishable Role its own specific
    relation, such as (for 'Student') 'startedAsStudent' and 
    endedAsStudent', each relation pointing to a particular date.
    When there can be multiple disjoint periods of time that
    a Role can be occupied (as with Student), that relation
    cannot be functional.  A third method to express the 
    time indexing of a role is to point to an instance of
    RoleSituation, which is a StaticSituation, and can
    specify all of the arguments of the Role.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Student is a Person who is formally registered

         Agent that has agreed to provide instruction.  Persons who
         study some topic by themselves without an instructor are
         not instances of this type.  The Role of Student is time-sensitive,
         and the time interval during which a Person is a Student should
         be specified using the 'startedAsStudent' and 'endedAsStudent'
         relations.  Although periods of being a Student at some
         institution may be disjoint, the 'wasTaughtBy' relation
         should be used only once for each different Teacher or
         School that a Student studied with.
         
         It would be convenient to have multiple-arity relations
          to distinguish which 'student' was registered at which
          instution when (which could be represented as an Event,

          An alternative work-around would be to have 'studentship'
          at different institutions be subtypes of the Student Role,
          e.g. 'StudentAtHarvard' could be one subtype of Student.</rdfs:comment>

            that is informally constituted.  Typically, a leader of an organization
            makes major decisions on behalf of the whole organization,
            has the authority to direct the organization's
            personnel to carry out those decisions, and is empowered to
            engage or negotiate with external agents to achieve the
            organization's goals.  This collection includes leaders
            of sub-organizations of larger organizations, such as
            department heads within larger organizations.  Note that a
            single person may be a leader in more than one organization.

     <rdfs:comment>For any Organization that has a recognized leader 
      who is a single person, this relation will point from the leader to 
      the Organization.  Likewise for groups of people that are not formally 
      organized, this relation can relate a leader to the group.
      It is unresolved whether a group can have a leader and not be
      considered as an 'Organization' - that remains to be
      decided, but for small groups that come together on a short-term
      basis and coalesce about a leader without having any other structure,
      this relation can serve to relate that leader to that group
      (consider a mob that follows a fiery speaker on the spur of the
      moment)..</rdfs:comment>

           NOTE: AN Oxidation of one substance necessarily involves 
            a reduction of another, and in chemistry, one speaks
            of 'redox' reactions, (reduction-oxidation).  But the
            term 'oxidation' commonly refers to the reaction of something
            relatively stable (iron, wood) with air, and the perspective
            is saliently from the side of the thing being oxidized.
            So there is no precise logical distinction between an
            oxidation and a reduction, unless one has a particular
            starting material in mind as one of the reactants.

        Cyc: (OxidationProcess): A collection of events.  In each instance of this

          who turns on the oil burner.
          
          A controlled fire in a forest for fire suppression is also a
          subtype.
          
          NOTE that this is a borderline case of 'PurposefulAction', since 
          the Agent's acting occurs often only at the beginning of the 
          event, especially with automatic cases like oil burners.
          
          @ToDo: At some point it may be necessary to distinguish the

            control his or her orientation to the object that the handle

            stationary with respect to some moving object, e.g., handles
            inside a subway car.  Note that handles are sometimes used
            to perform other functions, such as hanging one's dry

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="ShapingSomething">
        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of #$MaterialHandling (q.v.).
            Each instance of #$ShapingSomething is an event in which
            something (usually more or less  plastic  in nature) is
            given a definite shape, or has its shape changed, through
            the purposeful actions of an agent that cause a
            #$ShapeChangeEvent (q.v.).  Specializations include
            #$Carving, #$Sewing, and #$SpreadingOntoSurface.  In many
            (but not  all) cases, an instance of #$ShapingSomething is
            also a #$PhysicalCreationEvent  (see e.g. #$MakingPottery).
            Normally, a #$ShapingSomething concerns the basic,  overall
            shape of the object of change (see #$objectOfStateChange).
            Thus, a  #$PolishingSomething event is not a
            #$ShapingSomething, as it doesn't affect  the basic
            shape of the object being polished.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="FluidFlowEvent">
        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of #$MovementOrShapeChangeEvent.
            Each instance of #$FluidFlowEvent is an event in which a
            fluid moves (or a group of particles collectively moves).
            The spatial extent of the fluid may change (i.e. expansion
            or contraction, see #$ShapingSomething) and/or they may
            undergo a #$MovementEvent such as rotation (e.g. a whirlpool
            or a tornado) and/or translation.  If the fluid undergoes
            translation, then the event is also an instance of
            #$FluidFlow-Translation.  Examples of
            #$FluidFlow-Translation include `partial' motions such
            as occurs in rivers flowing, or jets of air blowing.
            Another kind of example of #$FluidFlow-Translation is
            #$FluidFlow-Complete, in which the fluid moves entirely from
            the #$fromLocation and to the #$toLocation.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A specialization of both #$FluidFlowEvent and

            #$FluidFlow-Translation, the moving object (see the

            #$FluidTangibleThing (i.e. a portion of some fluid, such as
            a quart of milk) rather than a discrete solid object.  At
            least some of the moving object leaves its original position
            (see the predicate #$fromLocation) and some arrives at the
            destination (see the predicate #$toLocation), but it is not
            necessary that all of the moving object go from the origin
            to the destination.  Instances of #$FluidFlow-Translation

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="ShapeChange">
        <rdfs:comment>SUMO: The Process of changing the shape of an Object.
        
        Cyc: (ShapeChangeEvent) A specialization of #$IntrinsicStateChangeEvent
            (q.v.) whose instances are events involving a physical
            object's changing shape.   A #$ShapeChangeEvent occurs
            when either (i) the  shape of some (usually more or less
            plastic ) object is changed in a fairly significant way,
            (ii) an object is created (see #$PhysicalCreationEvent)
            through a process in which a definite shape is imposed on
            some material, or (iii) an object is destroyed (see
            #$PhysicalDestructionEvent) through some process in which
            its shape is so radically altered that the it can no longer
            be said to exist.  Examples of these three respective cases
            include flattening an aluminum can with one's foot,
            fashioning a figure from clay, and steamrolling a birthday
            cake.  Shape changes are usually (though not necessarily
            always) the result of the shapee's being acted upon by
            another tangible thing (or things).  When a shape change of
            type (i) or (ii) occurs via the purposeful actions of some
            agent, the event is a #$ShapingSomething(q.v.).  Note that,
            in most contexts, very gradual changes in an object's
            shape - such as instances of #$Growth-Physical or #$Erosion
            - are not #$ShapeChangeEvents.</rdfs:comment>

     require a description as a unifying criterion. On the other hand, at any
     time, one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which
     a process of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes a
     situation. Since the decision of designing an explicit description that
     unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, application, etc.,     when aligning an ontology do DLP, there can be indecision on where to     align a process-oriented class. For example, in the WordNet alignment, we     have decided to put only some physical processes under 'process', e.g.     'organic process', in order to stress the social orientedness of DLP. But     whereas we need to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive     organic processes, these will be put under 'situation'. Similar     considerations are made for the other types of perdurants in DOLCE. A     different notion of event (dealing with change) is currently investigated     for further developments: being 'achievement', 'accomplishment', 'state',     'event', etc. can be also considered 'aspects' of processes or of parts of     them. For example, the same process 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley' can     be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought the current state     that e.g. we are trying to explain), as an achievement (the erosion     process as the result of a previous accomplishment), as a state (if we     collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as an     event (what has changed our focus from a state to another). In the erosion     case, we could have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another:     a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) condensation d) transition     (causality). If we want to consider all the aspects of a process together,     we need to postulate a unifying descriptive set of criteria (i.e. a     'description'), according to which that process is circumstantiated in a     'situation'. The different aspects will arise as a parts of a same situation.</rdfs:comment>

      Every CodeString must be part of a CodeList and must have a CodingAuthority who

      here referred to as a CodeString.  A CodeString may be a number.
      
      NOTE: that the name of each instance of CodeString in this ontology must be unique;
      therefore, the name of the CodeString is created by prefixing
      a code string prefix to the actual string that serves as the

      'representsCode' datatype relation.

        CodingAuthority, meaning that the same code may mean different
        things for different CodingAuthorities and on different 
        CodeLists.  The meaning must be found by referencing the
        specific CodeList used.  In the event that the same code is 
        used in one system (ontology or application) to mean different
        things, the amiguity must be resolved by specifying a 
        CodeList as the parent Type for each data instance represented

        Codes in databases; each such number will be an instance of
        a CodeString from a CodeList (which will often be represented as an

        the number even if it has no assigned system String.
        
        NOTE that this convention is used because there is a distinction between
        the representations of strings that are instances of an 'AbstractString'
        Type and strings that are encoded as system datatypes, though they
        are fundamentally the same conceotualk entities.  This is an implementation

            it is not correct to use the isInList relation to relate the CodeString

            by the isInList relation.  This isPartOfCodeList relation forms
            a shortcut, combining relations between the CodeString and
            the Code and between the Code and its CodeList.

    as a container for the items transported, and to be able to float
    stably in the water by itself without support.  The last requirement
    means that a Vessel must have a hull, and this eliminates water skis 
    and other marginal 'water transport' watercraft. 
    A vessel is not necessarily manned and does not have any lower or

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="DateTime">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#DateOrTime"/>
    <rdfs:comment>DateTime is a temporal location which is a time interval
      on the Universal time line, which is referenced to some
      point in historical time.  To represent a TimePoint, the corresponding
      DateTimePoint can be  used. The time interval may be represented
      explicitly or implilcitly. The time interval can be represented 
      explicitly by specifying both the beginning and ending of the
      interval using the relations relations 'hasStartingTimePoint' and
      'hasEndingTimePoint'.  When specifying time intervals by instances
      of this category, the time interval may also be represented implicitly 
      by taking advantage of the 'truncation' formalism:
       If only the date is specified, the time interval is one day
          starting at 00:00 of the date
       If date, hours, and minutes are specified, the time interval
         is one minute starting at the beginning of the minute specfied.
       If date, hours, minutes, and seconds are specified, the time interval
         is the length of time starting at the beginning of the second or fraction
         specified, and extending up to the time point that would be represented
         by increasing the last digit of the time.
         
         Thus, for time interval 2007-02-22T12:33:35.95
           the interval starts at point             2007-02-22T12:33:35.95
             and ends at the beginning of interval  2007-02-22T12:33:35.96
             ans lasts for one-hundredth of a second.
      
      The default format suggested allows representing both the date
      and the time inteval (point) within that date, and disambiguated
      time zone by either specifying the time zone 
      or assuming Greenwich mean time (UTC or Zulu), but also assuming 
      that the clock used is the NIST atomic clock signal.
      
      The length of the time interval may be explicitly specified by using the
      relations 'hasStartingTimePoint' and 'hasEndingTimePoint'
      
      Relativistic effects on time, when relevant, must be handled
      by specifying the clock which is used to measure the time.
      
      This Type is the base conceptual type that should be assumed 
      is intended when some specification of 'Time Stamp' or
      "datetime' is encountered in a data store.
      
      The string format in which a DateTime can be represented should
      at least support the WC3 standard which uses the format:
        YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss
       where YYYY is the year
             MM is the month
             DD is the day of the month
             'T' is the literal 'T'
             hh is the hour (24-hour clock)
             mm is the minute
             ss.sss is the seconds, which may or may not have a
                decimal fraction.
                
      From that reference, section 3.2.7:
      [Definition:]   dateTime values may be viewed as objects with integer-valued year,
      month, day, hour and minute properties, a decimal-valued second property,
      and a boolean timezoned property. Each such object also has one decimal-valued 
      method or computed property, timeOnTimeline, whose value is always a decimal number;
      the values are dimensioned in seconds, the integer 0 is 0001-01-01T00:00:00 and 
      the value of timeOnTimeline for other dateTime values is computed using the
      Gregorian algorithm as modified for leap-seconds. The timeOnTimeline values
      form two related 'timelines', one for timezoned values and one for non-timezoned 
      values. Each timeline is a copy of the 'value space' of decimal, with integers given
      units of seconds.
      
      The 'value space' of dateTime is closely related to the dates and times described 
      in ISO 8601. For clarity, the text above specifies a particular origin point 
      for the timeline. It should be noted, however, that schema processors need not
      expose the timeOnTimeline value to schema users, and there is no requirement that
      a timeline-based implementation use the particular origin described here in 
      its internal representation. Other interpretations of the 'value space'
      which lead to the same results (i.e., are isomorphic) are of course acceptable.
      
      All timezoned times are Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, sometimes called 
      "Greenwich Mean Time"). Other timezones indicated in lexical representations 
      are converted to UTC during conversion of literals to values. "Local" or 
      untimezoned times are presumed to be the time in the timezone of some 
      unspecified locality as prescribed by the appropriate legal authority;
      currently there are no legally prescribed timezones which are durations 
      whose magnitude is greater than 14 hours. The value of each numeric-valued 
      property (other than timeOnTimeline) is limited to the maximum value within 
      the interval determined by the next-higher property. For example, the day
      value can never be 32, and cannot even be 29 for month 02 and year 2002 (February 2002).
      
      
      Note:
      The date and time datatypes described in this recommendation were inspired
      by [ISO 8601]. '0001' is the lexical representation of the year 1 of the Common Era
      (1 CE, sometimes written "AD 1" or "1 AD"). There is no year 0, and '0000' is not
      a valid lexical representation. '-0001' is the lexical representation of 
      the year 1 Before Common Era (1 BCE, sometimes written "1 BC").</rdfs:comment>

    >DOLCE: An agentive social object that is the hypostasis of one rational physical object. It can be acted by othe rational physical objects or social persons though (through delegation).

    Note that in DOLCE a Natural-person is not a physical human being.  This may not
    be the usual interpretation of 'legal person' or 'natural person' but does not
    necessarily contradict Cyc or SUMO, it just makes the representation of legal 
    persons complex.  For every 'natural person' there should be a living human
    being who is represented by this concept.  The use of this concept needs to  
    be further elaborated (20070322).  Perhaps it should bre considered as a Role?</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >hasTemporalLocation is a general relation that can be used to 
      specify *when* events occurred or physical objects existed.  This
      relation has as its domain the union of PhysicalObject and TemporalThing, and
      that union serves much the same purpose as the OpenCyc 'TemporalThing',
      which has been redefined for COSMO.  The TemporalLocation will be
      a TimeInterval (in the universal timeline of our world or some alternative
      reality), which in COSMO may be a single TimePoint.
      
      NOTE that to have a TemporalLocation does not mean to fill that tempopral
      location - an Event may have a particular Year as a TemporalLocation,
      but may have occurred only on a particular day of that year.
      Thus we may also specify that some Process has a particular
      TemporalLocation, without being precise about when it
      started and when it ended.
      
      NOTE the distinction between TemporalThing and PhysicalObject, both of
      which *may* have a TemporalLocation.  A TemporalThing *must* have a 
      TemporalLocation, that is the essence of its definition.  A PhysicalObject
      *may* have a TemporalLocation - the ontology may choose to specify
      when it existed, but does not have to.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>isNormallyLocatedAt is a relation that relates 
      individual Objects or Object types to a location where it
      is typically (more often than not) found, thus
      specifying where they would 'normally' be located.  This is
      a crude way of encoding defaults and probabilities in
      locating objects.  Perhaps the most useful function
      of this relation is to specify where parts of things are 
      suppose to be located, when they are in their proper place.
      The proper location for Body parts or device parts can
      be specified using this relation.  The location
      can be a Type, or can be a specific location.</rdfs:comment>

    NOTE that we represent PostalAddresses as AbstractStrings.  This
    does not preclude the specification of structure to the string.
    PostalAddresses have structure that is dependent on the 
    Postal Authority that specifies the format.  Using this Type
    to specify an address makes the address an object rather than 
    a simple datatype string.
    
    The name of a PostalAddress can use the 'ADDR_' prefix, followed by
    the address itself, to make that address self-explanatory.
    A pair of underscores in the name '__'will symbolize
    an end-of-line character in the usual format of an address (e.g.
    after the street number), and an underscore should be interpreted
    as a space.
    
    Note that an Address that is a Building (such as a single-family residence)
     may have a name component following the 'ADDR_' prefix that is
     identical to the corresponding name component of the Building,
     folowing its prefix 'BLDG_', unless the building has a unique

      A collection of 'objects' with temporal extent. Each instance of
      #$Agreement involves two or more parties, who agree that certain 
      propositions should be true. Making the propositions true may 
      require some action or commitment of wealth on the part of one or 
      more of the #$agreeingAgents. Thus, instances of #$Agreement will 
      usually involve some instances of #$Obligation. Note: Instances of
      #$Agreement and #$Obligation differ, however, in that an #$obligatedAgent
      is responsible for the truth of all of the propositions in an obligation.
      In an #$Agreement, some agents may not be responsible for all of 
      the propositions in the agreement being true. For example, in a 
      loan agreement, the borrower agrees to give the lender back the money,
      but the borrower is the only #$obligatedAgent for the repayment.
      Note that #$obligatedAgents need not be among the #$agreeingAgents 
      in the agreement that involves or generates the obligation. For example,
      the Board of Directors of XYZCorporation may agree that some non-director
      will assume the post and duties of President of XYZCorporation. 
      Moreover, #$agreeingAgents aren't always #$obligatedAgents; e.g.,
      Wanda and Paul may agree that Paul alone is obligated to do some task. 
      Examples include instances of #$PeaceAccord, #$LegalAgreement,
      #$InformalAgreement, #$BusinessPartnershipAgreement, #$WorkAgreement, #$SalesAgreement, #$MaintenanceAgreement, #$Reservation, #$Appointment, etc.

            Each instance of #$Microtheory is an abstract informational
            thing that represents a context in Cyc.  Each microtheory
            (or 'mt') serves to group a set of assertions
            together that share some common assumptions; the assertions
            in an mt constitute the content of that mt.  Note that each
            assertion in the Cyc knowledge base must be explicitly
            stated to be true in at least one microtheory.  Assertions
            stated to be true in one mt will also be true  (by
            inference) in more specialized mts that depend on the
            content of that mt.  For example, if something is true in
            the #$HumanSocialLifeMt (q.v.), then it should by default be
            true in the more specialized #$UnitedStatesSocialLifeMt
            (q.v.).  Specialized microtheories are related to the more
            general microtheories on which they depend by the predicate
            #$genlMt (q.v.).  Note that every query is made in some mt,
            and the answer one gets to a query depends on the mt in
            which it is asked, since the only assertions which can be
            used to answer a query in an mt are those  explicitly stated
            to be true in that mt, or in some more general mt.  See also
            the predicate #$ist, which is used to relate an assertion to
            the microtheories in which it is true.</rdfs:comment>

          Cyc: A collection of microtheories; a subcollection of
            #$SupposedToBeMicrotheory.  Each instance of the collection
            #$Obligation is a microtheory which contains assertions
            describing what some agent (the #$obligatedAgents) is
            obliged to do, or make true, for one or more other agents,
            possibly including society in general.  An obligation is the
            most general case of some agent owing something to another.
            Obligations may be undertaken in conjunction with various
            kinds of #$Agreements.   Unlike an agreement, however, an
            obligation need not have a second known party (though some
            do).  An obligation can exist and be understood without
            identifying another particular agent as the
            'holder' of the obligation - and that may be
            true, even if the beneficiary (#$obligationOwedTo) can be
            identified.  For example, assuming that parents have an
            obligation to care for their children, it is not clear with
            whom a parent has 'agreed' to take care of his or
            her child.  Some common ways to incur an obligation are
            through social transactions (e.g. family duties, friendship,
            favors) or through financial transactions (e.g. a
            #$PaymentObligation).   In addition, obligations may be
            imposed on those who are subject to one or more instances of
            #$CodeOfConduct, e.g. #$SportsRulesOf-BoxingSportsEvent or
            #$OfficeCodeOfConductMt.</rdfs:comment>

    >A FieldOfStudy is a composite object, including both the accepted 
    knowledge - the lore - of some recognized field of knowledge, and also
    the theories and the methodology that the practitioners in the field
    use to discover or create new information in that field.  The paradigms
    discussed by Thomas Kuhn in his book 'The Structure of Scientific Reolutions' is
    included in the 'methodology' component, and also contains the
    models an exemplar experiments and results.  The representations
    in SUMO and Cyc do not correspond exactly to this representation.
    Termed 'FieldOfStudy' in both Cyc and SUMO.
    
    NOTE: what might be considered as instances of this Type, e.g. Chemistry, Physics,
     are represented as subtypes.  This is to allow specializations of the broad fields 
     (e.g. Biochemistry, NuclearPhysics) to be properly represented as subtypes, 
     and those especializations might in turn have specializations.
     Fields of study are not considered as conceptual individuals
     in COSMO.  This differs from the Cyc documentation.  Note also that because there
     are no instances, the restrictions below will never apply to any specific
     thing - rather, they are placeholders for axioms that can be used in
     inferencing on classes of things, when this ontology is porter to FOL,
     and are also intended to clarify the intended meaning.

   OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002: A specialization of #$AbstractInformationalThing.
     Each instance of #$FieldOfStudy is a particular area of study, with its 
     own distinctive set of theories, hypotheses, and problems. Instances
     of #$FieldOfStudy are typically the subject of teaching and/or research 
     within instances of #$AcademicDepartment (q.v.), although one #$AcademicDepartment
     may cover several instances of #$FieldOfStudy. Instances of #$FieldOfStudy 
     include #$ArtHistory, #$Physics, and #$ArtificialIntelligence.
     
     SUMO: An academic or applied discipline with recognized experts and with a core of 
     accepted theory or practice.  Note that FieldOfStudy is a subclass
     of Proposition, because a FieldOfStudy is understood to be a body
     of abstract, informational content, with varying degrees of certainty 
     attached to each element of this content.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>Each Cargo consists of one or more physical objects of
      transportable size (HumanScalObjects) that is or was being transported
      on a TransportationDevice in a TransportationEvent, for which a
      fee was paid in return for the service of carrying the item(s) 
        This is a Role, since items are 'Cargo' only while they are being 
        transported. Traveller's luggage which is carried for free is not Cargo,
        but if a traveller carries excess weight and must pay for 
        some item to be carried, that item is Cargo.
        
        This is the most general concept of Cargo; there are many
        subcategories of Cargo, some of which are regulated or taxed in
        specific ways by authorities that regulate shipping.
        
        NOTE that as a Group, this could be one or more items considered as a unit.
        
        NOTE that Cargo is a Role that must be related to
        some TransportationEvent.  But some TransportationEvents
        transport only pasengers, so the opposite is not 
        necessarily true.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="TransportationEvent">
        <rdfs:comment>An Event in which some physical object is moved from one
        location to another by means of a TransportationDevice.
    
      Named TransportationEvent[Cyc] and Transportation[SUMO]
     
      SUMO:  Motion from one point to another by means of a TransportationDevice.
    
      OpenCyc: A specialization of both #$Conveying-Generic and
            #$Translation-Complete, instances of which are events in
            which one or more objects transport one or more other
            objects.  Each instance  of #$TransportationEvent is an
            event in which an object (in the role of #$transporter) aids
            in the translational movement of another object (having the
            role of #$transportees), so that both objects move together
            along the same complete pathway (see
            #$motionPathway-Complete).  Optionally, one of these
            objects, or some third object moving along with them,
            provides the force to make the movement happen (see
            #$providerOfMotiveForce).  Examples of transportation events
            include automobile transportation, riding a bicycle, dogs
            pulling goods on a sled, a wagon with groceries rolling down
            a hill, a person carrying clothes in a suitcase, etc.  In
            that last case, note that the #$transporter is the suitcase,
            not the person.  Note that the transporter in a
            transportation event need not be in motion relative to its
            destination throughout the transportation event; an
            automobile transportation is a single transportation event
            even if it has sub-events in which the driver and all of the
            passengers disembark while the car is parked and refueled.
            A single transportation event may also have more than one
            transporter.  For example, a sofa may be transported accross
            a living room floor by two people working together.  Events
            which are _not_ #$TransportationEvents include a river
            conveying some flotsam, the wind blowing a leaf, a conveyor
            belt moving a widget to the next person on an assembly line,
            or a walking beast of burden that is carrying nothing.  The
            first three of these negative examples are instances of
            #$Conveying-Stationary, since the would-be #$transporter
            doesn't actually change its overall location (see
            #$conveyor-Stationary); in the fourth case the unburdened
            beast has no #$transportees and the event is an instance of #$AnimalWalkingProcess.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="SymbolicObject">
        <rdfs:comment>A SymbolicObject is an artifactual PhysicalObject created
           with the purpose of being or bearing some physical symbol that
           represents something other than the symbol itself; the represented
           thing may be abstract or physical.  The symbolism of a
           SymbolicObject does not depend on language to convey its
           intended meaning; it is primarily graphic in nature.
    
       Cyc: A specialization of both #$SymbolicThing and
            #$HumanAccessibleIBO. Each instance of #$SymbolicObject is a
            #$SymbolicThing  that has some material part (i.e. is an
            instance of #$PhysicalObject), and symbolizes some thing,
            event or achievement, without describing it propositionally
            in any detail.  Examples include national flags, military
            medals and ribbons, an Oscar, a Crucifix, a caduceus, and
            printed trademark logos of commercial brands.  Only some
            instances of #$SymbolicObject have the #$primaryFunction of
            serving as symbols (e.g. national flags, war memorials);
            others are symbolic in a secondary capacity (e.g. a
            gravestone symbolizes death but its primary function is as a
            marker), and/or acquire symbolic associations over time
            (e.g. Ellis Island).  Examples of #$SymbolicObject include
            the #$ArcDeTriomphe, the #$StatueOfLiberty, the
            #$PyramidOfCheops, a hangman's noose, a Menorah, a
            white dove.  Negative examples include #$NationalAnthems and
            #$Swastikas projected on walls, because these do not have a
            material part; for such symbols use the broader collection #$SymbolicThing.</rdfs:comment>

     A specialization of #$TemporalThing whose instances are more or less static,
     as compared (e.g.) to the more dynamic instances of #$Event. The clearest
     examples of #$SomethingExistings are tangible things, such as people, lakes,

    This relation is highly sensitive to time, and is only meaningful when applied 
    within the context of a travel event that is underway.  it is most
    useful for scheduled commercial travel events.  It is
    nevertheless useful for describing and reasoning about vehicles, especially
    large commercial ones, that are en route to some specific destination.
    
    Note that since the domain is a Vehicle, this relation cannot be used to
    specify the ETA for a person, unless indirectly by specifying the ETA
    for s vehicle that person is travelling in.
    
    Of course, not every vehicle may have a specific destination,

        <rdfs:comment>In Cyc called  'Projectile-Device'.
        
          A Projectile is an ArtifactObject designed to be 
            propelled by the impulse delivered either by another object,
            or by thrust generated from part of the object itself.
            In many but not all cases, after the impulse is delivered,
            the Projectile then travels solely under ballistic (gravitational)
            forces.  It may or may not not be a weapon; a baseball thrown to
            a catcher is a Projectile, as is a football or javelin.
            However, a rock thrown just to be skipped
            across the surface of a lake is not designed as a Projectile
            and is not an instance of this Type.  The role of
            'projectile' taken by various natural or artifact objects
            thrown by people or forces of nature would be
            specified by a case role relation.
            
          Cyc: The collection of all projectiles.  Some instances
            of this collection, such as cannon balls, arrows, missiles
            are (intended to be) thrown, hurled, fired, or launched at
            their targets.  The other instances, such as pistol
            cartridges, shot gun cartridges, or #$ArtilleryShells have
            parts which are intended to be fired at their targets.
            Many are #$ProjectileWeapons, e.g. instances of  #$Arrow,
            #$ProjectileSlug-Bullet, or #$Torpedo, while others are not,
            e.g. #$FootballBall-American. The motive force in a
            propelling of a #$Projectile-Device may come from a distinct
            #$ProjectileLauncher or #$Person, but many are
            self-propelled after leaving the launcher.
            
            NOTE that in SUMO every Projectile is a Weapon.  See
            'ProjectileWeapon' for the SUMO 'Projectile'.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A BallisticProjectile is a Projectile that

           This differs somewhat from Cyc 'Projectile-Device'
            in that weapons such as torpedoes which are under continuous
            thrust until they hit their target do not have a ballistic
            trajectory and are therefore not BallisticProjectiles.
            A bazooka shell, however, though
            it generates its own thrust, travels mostly after the thrust
            has stopped and under ballistic forces.</rdfs:comment>

            which means propelled by the thrust caused by the
            expulsion of matter from the craft.  Therefore
            a sunlight-driven solar sailing craft would not 
            be classified as a 'Spacecraft'.  This may have
            to be modified if, when such devices actually 
            begin to be used, a separate classification for solar
            sailing devices appears to be a problem.
            
            NOTE: a Spacecraft ia a Vehicle and must have its own means
            of propulson, so a passive satellite placed into orbit that
            cannot move itself around is not a spacecraft.

    >COSMO note: this sense of 'Sensor' is the device, and does not
      include biologicalsensors such as eyes or ears.  A sensor device
      is designed to be used for detection of some category of object
      or substance.
      
     Sensor definition from 'Ontology for Level-One Sensor Fusion
    and Knowledge Discovery' (by Marion G. Ceruti, Ph.D.)

    A sensor is a device that responds to a physical stimulus, (such as heat, light, 
    sound, pressure, magnetism, or a particular motion) and transmits a resulting impulse 
    for measurement or operating a control.  Sensors can be mechanical, electrical,
    electro-optical, chemical, or biological (part of a living organism). Sensors can be
    land based or platform based, such as towed arrays.  Related concepts include:
    signals, detection, modes of operation, detection threshold, tasking of sensors,
    sensor arrays, operational limitations (e.g. range, depth, distance and altitude),
    swath, resolution, passive sensors (e.g. hydrophone array), and active sensors
    (e.g. sonar). Concepts that deal with the interaction of signals with sensors
    include detection and signal-to-noise ratio mentioned in the section on signals.
    Sensor geometry is also important, as some sensors are not omni-directional. 
    Their geographical environment limits others. Thus concepts that apply to geometry in general, such as points, lines, line segments, polygons, circles, ellipses, and other spatial entities must also be part of an ontology that applies to sensors in particular.
    
    Some examples of spatial relationships and geometry as applied to sensors are as follows:
    1. An ellipse is drawn around a position to indicate the error in the position measurement.
      The major and minor axes of the ellipse represent the uncertainty in the coordinates
      of the position. 
    2. If a sensor must detect a target, the target must be within the range of
      the sensor, both in the distance (radius) and angularly (azimuth).
    
    Three-dimensional geometry is important when a sensor is located in a canyon
    and it depends upon a line-of-sight geometry to detect a target.

A homogeneous object such as a bar of iron or piece of wood would not normally be considered as in this category.

    <rdfs:comment>In COSMO a 'ConceptualWork' (a MentalObject) is
    classified as an AbstractSymbolicObject, since such works are always
    created in symbols, though the symbols may have information
    content - the 'meaning'.  COSMO differs somewhat from the
    Cyc description in that we consider Codes to be included, but 
    have a different usage of the term 'Code'.
    
    Cyc: OPENCYC 1: MAY 23, 2002
    The collection of abstract works which are the deliberate creations 
    of one or more individuals working in concert, have instantiations 
    [#$instantiationOfCW] which are #$InformationBearingThings, and
    associated #$AbstractInformationStructures. This is a specialization
    of #$DevisedPracticeOrWork [q.v.]. For works with propositional content
    see the more specific collection, #$PropositionalConceptualWork (PCW).
    Positive examples include: #$MobyDickNovel (as opposed to any instances
    of #$BookCopy such that (#$instantiationOfCW #$MobyDickNovel BOOK_COPY)),
    Beethoven's 9th Symphony (as opposed to any performance of this symphony 
    or any copy of its score). Negative examples include:
    games (performances are not IBTs), awards (they do not have associated
    #$AbstractInformationStructures), paintings (not abstract), customs
    (not deliberate creations), natural languages (not a deliberate creation), 
    and codes (their uses, not instantiations, are IBTs).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>COSMO we add the parent 'AbstractSymbolicObject' to the 
           Cyc concept 'Statement', which makes it clearly a mental object, rather
           than a physical object.  This is interpreted as the 
           abstract symbolic representation of a statement, not any 
           physical representation, and not the propositional
           (logical) content of the statement.
           
           NOTE that a Statement does not necessarily have to have an
           audience in mind (it could be demented rambling speech),
            and therefore is not necessarily part of a Communication.  The
            subtype 'LinguisticAssertion', however, must have an audience in
            mind, and is therefore constrained to be mentioned in (it might also 
            be a part of) some Communication.
           
           The propositional content of a Statement is a Proposition.
           
            Cyc:  A #$Statement is the #$InformationBearingThing
            created in a #$StatingSomething.  An #$Agent must create the

    >hasPhysicalRepresentation is the relation that points from some concept or thing,
    whether abstract or concrete, to a physical object that is intended as a
    representation of that thing.  Thus a picture or drawing of an object
    would be aphysical representation of that object.  Also, the physical marks
    on a piece of paper that spell out words in some language would be
    a physical representation of the abstract words, and those marks woujld
    also be a physical representation of the AbstractString
    that is in turn an abstract representation of the abstract words.
    
    Thus a physical representation such as the letters 'cat' you are looking at now
    can represent both an abstract representation (e.g. the AbstractString 'cat', 
    which has many such physical representations), or the more abstract notion of
    a cat, or of some actual physical cat.  Representations can take several levels,
    and for accurate reasoning it is necessary to keep them distinct.</rdfs:comment>

    >:isRestrictedTo allows one to specify that a relation?s values may be restricted when that relation is applied to some subclass of the original domain 1.  This can help to make the relation more clear, and may limit the range of necessary inferences.  Such restrictions are realized in Protege by modifying the allowed class of a value of a relation at the level of some particular class which is a subclass of the higher-level class on which the relation is defined.  This provision in Protege distinguishes between the top-level definition of a slot and its application at lower levels.

The formula (domain ?REL ?INT ?CLASS) means that the ?INT'th element of each tuple in the relation ?REL must be an instance of ?CLASS.  Specifying argument types is very helpful in maintaining ontologies.  Representation systems can use these specifications to classify terms and check integrity constraints. If the restriction on the argument type of a Relation is not captured by a SetOrClass already defined in the ontology, one can specify a SetOrClass compositionally with the functions UnionFn, IntersectionFn, etc.</rdfs:comment>

    The Book of Kells is not simply a religious manuscript. True, it contains 
    the four gospels of Mark, Mathew, Luke and John and that was the sole original 
    purpose of the book. But its age and its design, although damaged, allow us
    a glorious glimpse into the art and style of ancient Ireland. The book is, 
    quite simply, considered a crowning glory of the Celtic art form, and possibly
    one of the most important treasures of Western Europe.

    The history of the Book of Kells stretches back more than 1500 years
    to the 6th century AD. Some claim that none other than St. Columba himself
    had a hand in its production, but most ascribe it to others that followed 
    in his footsteps. The book was the work of at least two distinguishable 
    hands according to experts who place its origin slightly later than the 
    life of St. Columba.

    Experts are uncertain where the Book of Kells was first begun, but
    evidence points to the Isle of Iona, which was the center of St. Columba's 
    influence and the home of his church. Later, during the Viking raids of 
    the 9th century, it was moved for its protection to Kells Monastery,
    County Meath, Ireland. Here it remained for almost two hundred years, 
    until it was stolen in 1007. Its golden cover, which was probably 
    encrusted with gems, was ripped from the book, and the remainder 
    was thrown in a ditch. The book was soon recovered, but not before 
    it received some water damage to the front and back pages. Unfortunately, 
    its cover was forever lost. </rdfs:comment>

     The Temple Church is a late 12th century church in London located
     between Fleet Street and the River Thames. It was originally constructed
     as the church of a monastic complex known as the Temple, the headquarters
     in England of the Knights Templar. The Temple was the scene of important 
     negotiations leading to the signing of Magna Carta in 1215. After the
     destruction of the Templar order in the early 14th century, the Temple 
     became Crown property and was let to two groups of lawyers that evolved 
     into the Inner Temple and Middle Temple, which are two of the four 
     Inns of Court. The two Inns both use the church, which is famous for 
     its effigy tombs. It was heavily damaged during the Second World War 
     but has been largely restored. The area around the Temple Church is 
     known as 'Temple' and nearby is Temple tube station. It was also featured 
     as part of the novel 'The Da Vinci Code'.
     
     In the mid 12th century, before the construction of the church,
     the Knights Templar in London had met at a site in High Holborn in a
     structure originally established by Hughes de Payens. Because of the growth
     of the order, by the 1160s the site had become too confined, and the order 
     purchased the property of the current site for establishment of a larger compound.
     In addition to the church, the new compound originally contained residences,
     military training facilities, and recreational grounds for the 
     military brethren and novices, who were not permitted to go into the city 
     without the permission of the Master of the Temple.

     The church building comprises two separate sections. The original nave section,
     called the Round Church, and an adjoining rectangular section,
     built approximately half a century later, called the Chancel.

     The Round Church:  
           In keeping with the traditions of the order, the nave of the church
     was constructed on a round design based on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The nave is 55 feet in diameter is surrounded by the first-ever free-standing dark Purbeck marble columns. It is probable that the walls and grotesque heads were originally painted in colours.
It was consecrated on February 10, 1185 in a ceremony by Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. It is believed that Henry II was probably present at the consecration.
The Round Church contains the marble effigies of nine medieval knights, the most famous of whom is William Marshal, who is enshrined next to his sons. In January 1215 William served as a negotiator during a meeting in the Temple between King John and the barons, who demanded that John uphold the rights enshrined the Coronation Charter of his predecessor Richard I. William swore on behalf of the king that the grievances of the barons would be addressed in the summer, leading to John's signing of Magna Carta in June. William later became regent during the reign of John's son, Henry III, who later expressed a desire to be buried in the church.

     The Chancel:  
           In response to Henry III's desire to be buried in the church, in the 
     early 13th century, the choir of the original church was pulled down and a new
     larger structure, now called the Chancel, was built. It was consecrated 
     on Ascension Day 1240. Although Henry later altered his will with instructions
     to be interred in Westminster Abbey, one of his sons, who died in infancy,
     is buried in the Chancel.

      The chancel comprises a central aisle and two side aisles of identical width. 
      The height of the vault is 36 feet 3 inches. During the bombing raid in World War II 
      (see below), the dark Purbeck marble columns of the Chancel cracked 
      from the intense heat Although they still supported the vault, they were deemed
      unsound and replaced by replicas. The original columns had a light outward lean,
      an architectural quirk which was duplicated in the replacement columns.

Early Use by the Templars:  
The order was very powerful in England during its existence. The Master of the Temple 
sat in parliament as primus baro (the first baron of the realm). The compound 
was regularly used as a residence by kings and by legates of the Pope. The temple 
also served as an early depository bank, sometimes in defiance of the Crown's wishes
to seize the funds of nobles who had entrusted their wealth there. The independence 
and wealth of the order throughout Europe is considered by most historians to have been
the primary cause of its eventual downfall .

Later History:  
After the destruction and abolition of the Knights Templar in 1307, Edward II took control 
of the church as a Crown possession. It was later given to the Knights Hospitaller, who 
rented the Temple to two colleges of lawyers. One college moved into the part of the 
Temple previously used by the Temple's knights, and the other into the part previously used
by its priests, and they shared the use of the church. The colleges evolved into 
the Inner and Middle Temples, two of the four Inns of Court. Following a later agreement 
in 1608 by James I, the two Inns were granted the use of the church in perpetuity and
continue to use the Temple as their chapel to the present day.

In 1540, the church became the property of The Crown once again when Henry VIII abolished 
the Knights Hospitaller in England and confiscated their property. Henry provided a priest 
for the church under the former title 'Master of the Temple'. In the 1580s, the church was
the scene of the Battle of the Pulpits, a theological conflict between Calvinists and 
supporters of the Church of England.

The church went undamaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Nevertheless, it was 
refurbished by Christopher Wren, who made extensive modifications to the interior, 
including the introduction of an organ to the church for the first time. The church 
was restored again in 1841 by Smirke and Burton, who decorated the walls and ceiling 
in the high Victorian Gothic style, in an attempt to bring the church back to its 
original appearance.

On May 10, 1941, during the height of the Battle of Britain, a German air raid of 
incendiary bombs set the roof of the Round Church on fire, and the fire quickly spread 
by wind to the nave and chapel. The organ and all the wood of the church, including 
the Victorian renovations, were destroyed. During the renovation, it was discovered 
that the renovations made by  Wren in the 17th century were in storage and were replaced 
in their original position. The church was rededicated in November 1958.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="Energy">
        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note:  In Cyc this was named 'EnergyStuff'.
        A category is needed for energy, but the Cyc category
        is too heterogeneous, and is reinterpreted as being pure physical 
        energy.  As with substances and objects, the COSMO usage differs from Cyc
          In COSMOthese distinctions are made;
             Energy -- an abstract notion of 'Energy substance'
               or 'Energy Stuff' which specifies qualitatively the
               kind of energy that is contained in any given
               quantity of energy: potential energy, thermal energy,
               nuclear energy.  Analogous with substance and Object in COSMO,
               a quantity of energy consists of a density of energy
               multiplied by the quantify of matter that contains that
               kind of energy. (A quantity of matter consists of a desniity of
               some type of matter multiplied by the space in which that matter
               is distributed.  The conceptual units of this kind of
               'energy' is (energy measure - of a particular type) divided
               by the (mass of matter containing energy at that density).
               This a lump of coal might have 30 kilocalories of
               chemical energy per gram, and that would be the kind
               and density of energy inn that lump of coal.
               
               This category is not a particular quantity of energy and is therefore not
               equivalent to a physical object.  It is more like a 
               substance than an object.
        
          QuantityOfEnergy: In our universe an alternative form of matter.  
            Each QuantityOfEnergy has some  equivalent in mass,
            This is distinct from an energy measure - the analogy would be
            that a QuantityOfEnergy is an Object, and is measured by
            an EnergyMeasure, just as a PhysicalObject is measured by a MassMeasure.

            and/or some regular temporal pattern to the component sounds
            (i.e., rhythm).  Instances of #$Music include the debut

            Bernstein's rendition of the Ninth Symphony with the
            BPO in Berlin in 1989, a particular playing of a particular

            instance of #$Device-UserPowered is an artifact deliberately
            designed to perform a particular function, and one which
            depends upon the physical efforts of the user to perform
            that function in part or in whole.  A paradigm  example
            would be a bicycle.  However, the definition also leaves
            room  for some counterintuitive cases - for example, combs
            and forks also qualify as user-powered devices.  Borderline
            cases would be devices which  require effort on the part of
            the user to perform part of the function,  but not all of
            it.  For example, many gas-powered lawnmowers have to be
            pushed by hand, but use an internal combustion engine to
            impart the necessary velocity to the cutting surfaces.</rdfs:comment>

            SUMO: A sharp object used for cutting.  The object must 
            have at least single blade or major protrusion which may be sharp at its 
            end as well.  It may be sharp on both sides, or just one.  Unlike an awl 
            it has a sharp edge rather than a point.  Unlike scissors, it is a single 
            blade without additional articulated parts.  Unlike an axe, a knife is 
            well-designed for slicing rather than chopping, although a heavy knife 
            such as a broadsword can also be used for chopping, whereas a non-knife is 
            not well designed for slicing meat for example.  A knife can be small like 
            a pocket knife, or large like a two-handed broadsword.  A knife may also 
            include other protrusions such as in the split swords and trident-like

            primary equipment consists of groups of naval ships and
            (sometimes) submarines that are in a relatively defined area

            the #$UnitedStatesNavy uses the word, as in e.g.  U.S.

  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="intendedPrimaryFunction">
        <rdfs:comment>This is a Cyc concept. See also hasDesignFunction.
        The Cyc range (SituationRole) was expanded to include DesignFunction.
        DesignFunction includes funcitons of naturally evolved systems,
        but an Artifact will typically not have a DesignFunction similar
        to that of a physiological system - but it might, as in synthesis
        of biochemicals.
        
         Cyc:  A specialization of  both #$primaryFunction and
            #$intendedBehaviorCapable (qq.v.)  that is used to indicate
            the primary or typical use a given  artifact (see
            #$Artifact-Generic) was designed to serve.
            (#$intendedPrimaryFunction ARTIFACT SITTYPE ROLE) means that
            (i) the primary function of ARTIFACT is to play ROLE in
            situations of  the type SITTYPE and (ii) ARTIFACT was
            intended by its designer  primarily to play ROLE in
            SITTYPEs.  For example, the  intended primary function of a
            #$MammographyProvider is to  provide service (see
            #$providerOfService) in
            #$MammographicBreastCancerScreenings; and the intended
            primary function of a #$Pump-Mechanical is to cause things
            to move  (see #$providerOfMotiveForce) in
            #$ConveyingMaterials events. Most artifacts have just one
            intended primary function, but  some have more than one.
            For example, a clock-radio has two intended primary
            functions: displaying the current time of day  and
            converting transmitted radio signals into audible sounds.
            Note that in #$SimpleDeviceFunctioningMt, however, it is
            assumed that every #$PhysicalDevice has only one intended
            primary function.</rdfs:comment>

        represent statements like 'I bought a carton of milk', where
        what was bought was both the milk and the containing carton.
        However, linguistic interpretation depends on context; to assert
        that 'I drank a carton of milk' does not imply that the 
        containing carton was consumed; in this case only the contents 
        would be the interpretation of 'carton of milk'.</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="Stream">
        <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: In Cyc, objects and regions were intermixed,
           and Stream was a subtype of 'EcologicalRegion'.  In COSMO a region
           and the things in it are distinct and can never be the same thing,
           so the parent Region was eliminated.  However, the generic 
           'isLocatedAt' relation  in COSMO can take a PnysicalObject as
           the object of the relation, so a Stream, which is a PhysicalObject,
           can be located at itself.
           
           A Stream is an object that must contain a stream bed, and may
           contain water - i.e. a stream may be partly dry and still be
           a stream, but it must contain some water in some part,
           or it will be a different type of object.
           
           There is still some difficulty with representing a stream as
           both a Path and a PhysicalObject.  The Path is in one
           sense a path for the water of the stream (and only peripherally
           for the objects moving on the water).  So the river should include
           some part of the river bed, and that make its inheritance of
           'BodyOfWater' problematical, as the bed itself is not water.
           
           COSMO-ToDo - needs more clarification.  The use of
           'container and contents' may resolve the problem here,
           but care needs to be taken to assure that the logic of
           substances can avoid problems if a ContainerAndContents is
           listed as a subtype of the substance that are the contents.
           
           Cyc: A specialization of #$Water-Fresh,
            #$InanimateThing-Natural, and #$FlowPath.  Each instance of
            #$Stream is a natural body of fresh water that flows when it
            is not frozen.  A stream can either be a great river (see
            #$River) or a  tiny creek (see #$Creek).  Every non-frozen
            stream flows in (see #$in-ContOpen) some conduit (see
            #$FluidConduit) such as a streambed or riverbed.  Notable
            instances of #$Stream incluide #$AmazonRiver,
            #$LittleMissouriRiver, #$WoundedKnee-Creek.  Note that
            riverbanks are not streams nor are they parts of streams,
            but rather they mark the edges of streams.

            Each instance of #$Credential is specific information about 
            one #$SocialBeing (q.v.), provided by another
            #$SocialBeing.  The information content of a credential
            consists of favorable, enabling, or
            empowering propositional declarations.  Although each
            instance of #$Credential is wholly intangible, instances of
            #$Credential usually have some associated #$TextualMaterial
            (e.g. a diploma associated with a college degree, a
            driver's license).  A credential may certify that the
            holder (i.e. the subject of the credential) has a particular
            skill (e.g. legal bar certification or the ability to
            drive); has completed certain training (e.g. GED schooling
            or satisfying PhD requirements); is allowed to do a certain
            thing (e.g. a travel visa or permission slip); and so on.

        testifying to the existence of some situation - e.g. the competence of an

        accompanied by the issuance of a physical Certificate (in some

        of the Assertion.  In COSMO the issuance of a Certificate is a
        requirement for an assertion to qualify as a Certification.
        
        A Certification may initially be verbal, but if it is only verbal with no 
        other physical evidence, it may disappear when the sound waves or their
        impressions in the minds of listeners disapper - in which case it would

         <rdfs:comment>The emission process. The entity that does the

             COSMO note: 'EmittingStuff' is interpreted as
              a specialization of the event 'EmittingAnObject'.  In 
              'EmittingStuff' the thing emitted is of a gaseous or
              liquid nature, and the emission process a relatively
              continuous process rather than an abrupt event.
              Thus a radioactive atom emitting an electron 
              would be an 'EmittingAnObject' event, while
              crying and emitting tears would be an 'EmittingStuff'
              event.   The borderline case of spitting would
              be EmittingAnObject, as would the event in which a
              skunk sprays foul-smelling stuff on another
              animal that disturbs it..</rdfs:comment>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="ChemicalEvent">
       <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#PhysicalTransformationEvent"/>
        <rdfs:comment>Any of a broad class of Events in which one or more
        chemical substances change the identity of the substance in
        some way.  This may be as subtle as a change of concentration,
        or a dilution, without  change in the covalent
        bonds of any substance involved, or adhesion of a substance
        at the surface of another substance in a manner that forms
        bonds that may be non-covalent by still require some energy to break.
          In COSMO we take a broad abstract view of Substances, and even such
        subtle changes in Substances are here considered as 
        PhysicalTransformationEvents.  Because in COSMO, a
        particular Type of substance at different concentrations is
        considered as different subtypes of a common substance, their
        identies differ at different concentrations, and 
        even a dissipation of some gas into a larger volume of space
        is viewed as destroying one substance and creating another.
        
        NOTE that in Cyc PhysicalTransformationEvent and
        'PhysicalTransformationProcess' are distinct, but even though
        in COSMO Events and processes are more differentiated than in Cyc,
        as of this version (0.36) we are not representing Porcesses
        separeately from Events, and 'PhysicalTransformationProcess'
        is omitted.
        
        To represent changes in the molecular structure of 
        substances, use the subtype 'ChemicalTransformationEvent'.</rdfs:comment>
    </owl:Class>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="ChemicalTransformationEvent">
       <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#ChemicalEvent"/>
        <rdfs:comment>An Event in which one or more chemical
        substances change the identity of the substance by
        changing the internal molecular structure.
        
        In the case of ionic substances, mere mixture in
        solution is not a ChemicalTransformationEvent, but
        if a mixing of ionic substances causes precipitation
        of a substance that was not present at the beginning,
        (e.g. mixing sodium chloride solution with silver
        nitrate solution and precipitating silver chloride)
        that would be a ChemicalTransformationEvent.
        
        A ChemicalTransformationEvent can be caused by mere heating
        of a substance, or in the case of unstable substances, the
        chemical transformation may proceed without any change
        in the environment of the substance.
        
        Similar to SUMO 'ChemicalProcess':
        SUMO: A ChemicalProcess occurs whenever 
         chemical compounds (CompoundSubstances) are formed or decomposed.  
         For example, reactants disappear as chemical change occurs, and products 
         appear as chemical change occurs.  In a chemical change a chemical 
         reaction takes place.  Catalysts in a ChemicalProcess may speed up the 
         reaction, but aren't themselves produced or consumed.  Examples: rusting of 
         iron and the decomposition of water, induced by an electric current, to 
         gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen.

        which may be as subtle as a non-covalent binding of one

        a different view of Substances, and even such subtle
        changes in Substances are here considered as 
        PhysicalTransformationEvents.
        
        For interactions of two or more substances where some
        change in the covalent chemical structure of one occurs, 
        use 'ChemicalReaction'.
        
        Cyc: This is the class of chemical interactions, events

<owl:Class rdf:ID="ChemicalDecomposition">
        <rdfs:comment>ChemicalDecomposition is a ChemicalTransformationEvent 
           in which one PhysicalSubstance decomposes into one or more 
           Substances of different composition.  A single molecule may
           decompose into another single molecule, as in the case
           where a protein denatures into a different three-dimensional
           form, but most decompositions give rise to more than one
           product.  Cases where a solvent (such as water) is a reactant
           (such as in the case of hydrolysis) may behave kinetically as though
           they were a decomposition, but are categorized as chemical 
           reactions, not decompositions in COSMO.
           
           NOTE: In Cyc and SUMO Combustion is considered as a 'decomposition',
            so simple decompostions involving only one reactant are 
            confloated with reactions involving more than one reactant.
            The essence in SUMO and Cyc seems to be that one chemical
            is broken down into multiple parts rather than undergoing a clean
            simple reactio0n.  We leave it that way in COSMO for
            the moment (v0.36), and will create a more detailed classifiation
            of reactions in the future.  See 'Combutions' as a 
            subtype.
           
           A polymerization, such as in making polyethylene, involves 
           a single starting substance, but is not a decomposition because
           the product is not of lower or identical molecular weight.
           Since mre than one molecule reacts in a polymerization (even if it
           is of the same chemical species), a polymerization
           is a reaction.
           
           Cyc: A collection of events in which a #$ChemicalObject
            is broken down into other instances of a different type.  In
            a simple decomposition, one #$ChemicalObject breaks down
            into two simpler substances, for example, #$Water decomposes
            into #$Hydrogen and #$Oxygen.  In a double decomposition,
            two compounds recombine to form two different compound types.

          'IntentionalAgent' which includes some animals (such as mammals),

          deception (or acts evaluated as sucessful deception) are

            deliberately and successfully influences the actions of
            another (or at least the other's dispositions to act).
            This collection is restricted to  influence  through

            through rational persuasion, through appeals to emotion, or

            by the application of physical force - e.g. twisting your

            influenced agent acting in a way the influencer did not

            my horror) by beating someone up.</rdfs:comment>

            that this collection is intended to embrace only signals
            themselves, not events of signalling. On the importance of
            keeping these two separate, see the comment on
            #$InformationBearingThing. The distinction between this
            collection and #$SymbolicThing lies in the fact that
            #$Signals are one-time-only transfers of specific
            information, whereas a #$SymbolicThing is open to its
            characteristic interpretation any time it is encountered.
            See also #$signifiesTo, #$signifiedBy.

           NOTE: IN SUMO, Signalling is an InentionalProcess and since
           this 'Signal' Type is not necessarily intentional, the SUMO
           category is a subtype.
            
            In SUMO, approximately equivalent to 'Signalling':
            SUMO: Signalling is the subclass of Guiding 
              processes in which an agent, animate or inanimate, sends a signal to 
              another Object.  In many cases, this signal will be an electrical or 
              electronic one.  Some signals may directly control the behavior of 
              the object signalled, while others may merely cause information to be 
              presented.  Instances of electrical Signalling are typically more 
              complex than simply than operation of a DeviceSwitch, though in some 
              cases, Signalling involves remote activation of such a switch by another 
              device.</rdfs:comment>

            to satisfy an educational requirement, then John's watching the movie is an

        <rdfs:comment>This Type is a merger of the Cyc Types
         'PlayingAGame' and 'GameEvent'.  As an Event,each
         instance of GameEvent must be an execution of some
         'Game', which is the structured activity specifying the
         rules for the game.  In SUMO, 'Game' is considerd
         the execution itself, but in COSMO the term 'Game' is used for the
         rules describing the game, which is a 'Procedure'.
         
          The Cyc distinctions seem too fine to warrant separate 
          Types, and the separate Types can be dissociated if
          some reason to do so appears.
          
          Cyc (PlayingAGame) A specialization of #$Playing and
            #$Event-Organized.  Each instance of #$PlayingAGame is an
            event in which a person plays a game.  Examples include
            people playing chess and people long jumping.
            
          Cyc: (GameEvent) A collection of individual Events.  Each instance
            of #$GameEvent includes the entirety of some game, from the
            beginning to the point where a conclusion is reached (there
            is a winner, there is a draw, or the game is abandoned).
            Each #$GameEvent has as #$subEvents one or more instances of
            #$PlayingAGame, but may have other sorts of significant
            #$subEvents as well.  For example, a particular
            #$FootballGame-American, in its entirety, would be an
            instance of #$GameEvent.  That game's subEvents would
            include, among other things, instances of (#$PlayingFn
            #$FootballGame-American) performed by some
            #$FootballPlayer-American, instances of #$EvaluatingAnAction
            performed by some #$Referee, and instances of
            #$MeasuringSomething performed by some #$SportsOfficial.  A
            game of Monopoly, from beginning to end, would be an
            instance of #$GameEvent, with subEvents possibly including
            instances of #$PlayingABoardGame, #$DisputeEvent,
            #$DistributionEvent, and (#$CleaningFn #$Table-PieceOfFurniture).            In SUMO, called 'Game':

            'Context'
            
         Defining a DatabaseGroup as a context provides
          one mechanism to include Context in an OWL
          ontology while still keeping the assertions
          to RDF triples.  The appearance of any assertion
          that involves an entity from a DatabaseGroup
          can be assumed to be true only within the
          Context that is represented by that DatabaseGroup.
          
          NOTE that a DatabaseGroup must have at least one
          Database defined as a Component entity, but the
          DatabaseGroup may also contain other component
          entities, such as global constraints that apply
          accross the DatabaseGroup.  This is true
          as of COSMO version 0.32.  Possibly,
          membership in the group may be restricted to
          Databases, and constraints can be related by
          a relation on the Group - at this point the
          best mechanism is unclear.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A DatabaseTable is a Table which is part of a 
          Database.  A single Table may be intended to represent
          only one or more than one type of entity; see the relations
          'tableCorrespondsToEntity' and 'tableCorrespondsToEntities'.
          The entities may be Types or Relations in the ontology.
          The columns (fields) of the table may correspond
          to attributes of the entity represented, or to relations
          that that entity has to other entities in the database.
          When a field (column) is intended as a Relation, the
          column will in general be a ForeignKey whose value
          will be a PrimaryKey in some other table in the
          Database.
          
          A DatabaseTable should be specifically represented in a
          database as a physical table or a view.  By contrast,
          a DatabaseSubtable is constructed only in the process of mapping
          an ontology to a Database, and is not represented as such in 
          the database itself.
          
          The rows (records.tuples) of a DatabaseTable will usually represent
          one or more assertions (attributes, column values) about some individual
          entity (often an instance of a Type in the ontology).  There may be
          many different assertions about the same individual,
          each assertion taking up one record.  The multiple assertions
          may specify, for example, how a particular attribute of an
          individual (a bank account balance, for example) changes over
          time; or a record may represent some particular event
          such as a financial transaction, of which there may
          be many examples.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A MultipleEntityTable is a DatabaseTable that
          represents more than one type of Entity.  For any
          given row (record), the properties of only one
          entity will be represented.  For such a Table, one
          can in theory factor it into several tables, each
          representing one entity.  Those (virtual) subtables
          would be represented as 'DatabaseSubtables'.
          
          A MultipleEntityTable should have at least one column that
          contains a value indicating which type is represented by
          any given record.  This column is specified by the relation
          'hasDistinguishingColumn'.  If not, there would need to be 
          some list of columns for each type, indicating that a value
          in that column signals that the record represents that
          type.  If that is not possible, it would be necessary to 
          represent the table as the common parent type of all the types
          represented by the table.  If none of these tactics serve
          to properly represent the table, the table may not be
          accurately representable (and should be redesigned).

       <rdfs:comment>A DatabaseSubtable is a portion of a DatabaseTable
          consisting of some subset of the records (rows) of some DatabaseTable.
          This Type is needed when some DatabaseTable is used to represent
          more than one Type of entity (see MultipleEntityTable).  
          A  DatabaseSubtable would be a virtual table, nt represented
          as such in the database itself, whose column names are identical to the
          column names for the MultipleEntityTable from which it was
          extracted.
          
          A DatabaseTable should be specifically represented in a
          database as a physical table or a view.  A DatabaseSubtable
          is constructed only in the process of mapping an
          ontology to a Database, and is not represented as such in 
          the database itself.
          
          There may be tables representing multiple entities for which a
          Subtable cannot be recognized: the records that represent one Type
          in a Subtable must be recognizable by the value in some field in the
          whole DatabaseTable.
          For example, a table that represents the characteristics of people
          and non-human animals might have a special field labeled 'BorH',
          which distinguishes humans from Beasts (non-human animals), and
          for humans, the value in that field would be 'H', and for
          Beasts the value would be 'B'.  There might be columns that are not used
          for Beast, and likewise columns not used for Human.  Concatenating
          types like this may only be useful when there are multiple columns (fields) 
          that are shared by the different types.  In these cases, one field may
          in fact have multiple interpretations, differing for each type represented.
          
          See also the relation 'tableCorrespondsToEntities'.
          
          The entities may be Types or Relations in the ontology.
          The columns (fields) of the table may correspond
          to attributes of the entity represented, or to relations
          that that entity has to other entities in the database.
          When a field (column) is intended as a Relation, the
          column will in general be a ForeignKey whose value
          will be a PrimaryKey in some other table in the
          Database.
          
          The rows (records.tuples) of a DatabaseTable will usually represent
          one or more assertions (attributes, column values) about some individual
          entity (often an instance of a Type in the ontology).  There may be
          many different assertions about the same individual,
          each assertion taking up one record.  The multiple assertions
          may specify, for example, how a particular attribute of an
          individual (a bank account balance, for example) changes over
          time; or a record may represent some particular event
          such as a financial transaction, of which there may
          be many examples.</rdfs:comment>

       <rdfs:comment>A ColumnValueString is an AbstractString that
        represents the value for a column in a DatabaseTableColumn.
        This Type serves a function in allowing the actual values
        of database fields to be represented in the ontology, when
        needed to properly interpret the database.  Its
        motivating use is to permit an ontology to specify which 
        values in a particular DatabaseTableColumn are used to
        flag that a particular record represent a particular Type, when the
        whole Table represents more than one Type of ontology entity.
        When there is only one column that satisfies the relation
        'hasDistinguishingColumn', the value in that column will
        specify what type of entity is represented by each particular record.
        
        To assure that each instance of this Type has a unique name, 
        the actual string value can be prefixed by a concatenation of
        the DatabasePrefix, the DatabaseTablePrefix, and the 
        Column name.  Thus the value 'E' in field 'EorM' of table 'Employee' of
        database 'Payrol' might have the name: 'PAY__EMP__EORM__E'.
        Such a name can be parsed to recover the information as to in what
        field in what database it is used.

        be intended to represent an Entity - a common
        example is a pair of columns representing a measurement,
        one column containing the quantifier (e.g. a number) and
        the second being the Unit of Measure. Two or more columns (fields) in
        a table may correspond to an ontology relation that has an arity 
        greater than 2.
        
        Because each DatabaseTableColumn has
        a unique name in an ontology, it is also possible to 
        map an entity to multiple parts of multiple tables in
        multiple databases.

        <rdfs:comment>A DatabaseRecord is one Row
        ('record') in a Table which is part of a Database.
        The Row will often represent a set of facts about some individual
        entity, of the type labeled by the Table name, and the
        individual cells in that row will represent the
        values of the attributes or pointers to
        other entities that are related to the entity
        represented by that row.  NOTE that in COSMO
        a Databaserecord is considered as a LinguisticAssertion, 
        being an assertion of one or more facts about an an entity.
        
        One record in an 'Employees' table may represent one
        (current) employee in an organization.  In that case the
        fields will represent attributes of the Employee related to 
        his/her employment.  A single record might also
        represent an Event, such as a sales event.  A single record
        might also represent one time point in a history of a
        single Entity, indicating, for example, where a particular 
        airplane was at different times during a journey.

        In order to be a unique term in the ontology, the actual record (row) name
        will be prefixed by a symbol (unique as a DB colum prefix)
        indicating the Database and DatabaseTable in which the
        DatabaseRecord occurs.  The record (row) identifier will be aunique identifier
        which is either a single value serving as a one-column master key,
        or the full set of keys required to uniquely identify the row
        
            The Row identifier may be simlpy a unique ID, or it might be
            some other string unique to an individual entity, such as
            a serial number (for a product) or a telephone number (for
            an individual).</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>columnCorrespondsToRelation points from
         A DatabaseTableColumn to some Relation in the ontology
         that has the same meaning as the relation between the 
         Type represented by the table,and the Type represented
         by the column.  For this relation to hold, the 
         DatabaseTableColumn will represent some attribute
         or relation on the Type that is represented by the
         DatabaseTable. This relation
         will point to a relation (owl:ObjectProperty or 
         owl:DatatypeProperty).
         
         This relation is distinct from 'columnValuesHaveType',
         which points to the ontological Type that the
         values in the column should be instances of. This
         will be particularly relevant when the column
         values are Foreign Keys into another table.
         Relation columnValuesHaveType is also useful when the
         implied type of the column values is narrower than
         the range of the relation that the column represents.  
         It is also useful when the values in the column
         may be lists of values rather than individual values.
         
         Also distinct is the data format (e.g. number, string)

         NOTE: this may be redundant with 'columnValuesHaveType'
         for columns that are keys referring to other tables that represent
         ontology types.  But where the values in a column have
         a particular intended type, but there is no table in the DB that
         represents that Type (e.g. the values are merely strings),
         this relation will allow understanding of the
         intended meaning, and interpretation with respect to the base knowledge 
         of the ontology.  In addition, where a field may have a list of values
         rather than a single value, the specification of the act that is is
         a list will be done by the 'columnValuesHaveType' relation.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>columnValuesHaveType relates a
      DatabaseTableColumn to the ontological Types (or relations)
      in the ontology, of which the values in the column should
      be instances.  For example, if a column
      named 'Author' is intended to refer to the author of
      some conceptual work (text, music), the relation
      'columnHasType' should point to 'IntelligentAgent',
      since intelligent agents (usually people, organizations,
      or groups of people) are the only entities that can
      author conceptual works.  That relation might point more
      specifically to 'Author' if it is intended that
      the values that are present in the column would
      all be instances of Type 'Author' (one who does
      not have to be a professional, but must have
      written a prose composition).  If it is intended
      that the DatabaseTableColumn refer only to professional
      writers, this relation could point to 'Writer'.
      
      This relation will often be unnecessary, as DatabaseColumns
      will be represented as relations, and most of the relations
      will have an explicit type as a constraint on the value.
      Specifying the type in those cases would be redundant.
      But in cases where the value in a cell is actually a list
      of values rather than a single value, this relation should be used 
      to specify that the value is a list, so that it can be parsed
      and properly interpreted.  Also, where the interpretation of
      the type of the value is intended to be more spcific than
      the default type restriction on the relation, the increased
      specificity can be indicated by this relation.
      
      This relation corresponds to the 'Type' that 
      is represented in some database schemas.
      
      
      NOTE: columnValuesHaveType is distinct from
        'columnHasFormat', which specifies the physical
         data format (e.g. number, string) which a column
         in a particular database table has.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>recordWasCreatedBy is a specialization of the general
    relation 'wasCreatedBy', specific for DatabaseRecords.  This relation relates
     a DatabaseRecord to the agent (usuallly a Person) who created
     it.  A DatabaseRecord might also be created automatically by
     a program, which can also be an instance of 'CognitiveAgent'.
     
     Although this relation and its parent point to an Agent who
     created a DatabaseRecord, the fields in actual databases
     may either (1) have values that are simply string datatypes, or
     (2) may be foreign keys with pointers into some other table(s)
     in the database, representing a person (or other 'creator').
     In order to create a mapping from a Database to this ontology,
     when a string-denominated field such as a 'CREATED_BY' column in
     some database is imported into the ontology, an entity of
     type GenericAgent should be created (if it does not already 
     exist) to fill the ontology relation value.
     
    When representing databases in which a 'creator' record value
    is a simple string rather than a foreign key, the relation
    'recordWasCreatedByAsString' should be used, rather than this
    relation,so the implementing system will be able to interpret
    it properly.
 
     If the value of the field is a datatype string and it looks like a
     person (or there is some constraint as to who can create
     database records), the import routine should find or create
     an instance of Person as the value of the mapped ontology 
     entity.  This should be effecive if there is already a list
     of employees or contractors with permission to create
     database records.
     
     For each given database, use this relation in a separate listing
     with 'correspondsToDB_Column' relation triples to specify 
     which table columns correspond to this relation. For
     example, if a database table with prefix code 'ABCD'
     has a 'creator' field called 'SourceID', pointing to
     a record in another table, this relation will be
     related to that column by the relation:

    <rdfs:comment>recordWasCreatedByAsString is a specialization of
    relation 'recordWasCreatedBy', specific for DatabaseRecords
    where the 'creator' field is simply a datatype string rather
    than a pointer into a table representing people (or other agents).
    This relation relates a DatabaseRecord to the agent (usually a Person)
    who created it, but signals the interpreting program that 
    the creating agent has no direct referents in the database.
    The implementing program will have to interpret it as
    appropriate in the application.
    
    When representing databases in which a 'creator' record value
    is a simple string rather than a foreign key, this relation
    could be used, rather than the parent 'recordWasCreatedBy'.
    However, if there is any other reference in the database to
    persons who may be named in the Creator field, it would be better
    to represent the values as reified people (and even better to have
    contact information, so they can be found when questions arise).

     In general, to create a mapping from a Database to this ontology, when
     a string-denominated field such as a 'CREATED_BY' column in
     some database is imported into the ontology, an entity of
     type GenericAgent should be created (if it does not already 
     exist) to fill the ontology relation value.
     
     If the string which is the value of the field looks like a
     person (or there is some constraint as to who can create
     database records), the import routine should find or create
     an instance of Person as the value of the mapped ontology 
     entity.  This should be effecive if there is already a list
     of employees or contractors with permission to create
     database records.
     
     For each given database, use this relation in a separate listing

   Cyc: A collection of physical devices.  An instance of
            #$SecurityDevice is any device designed to protect people or
            goods from being harmed (or stolen) intentionally.  Some
            instances of #$SecurityDevice accomplish this by keeping
            unauthorized or unwelcome intruders away from the people or
            materials in question (e.g., elements of #$AntiTheftDevice,
            #$PerimeterSensor).  Others are designed to make it
            impossible or difficult to remove goods (e.g., elements of
            #$Lock).  Compare with #$SafetyDevice, whose elements are
            designed to protect an object or animal against accidental
            harm.  Of course some devices play multiple roles --- a
            single fence may be a security device to keep burglars out,
            and may protect toddlers from wandering in and falling into
            a swimming pool..</rdfs:comment>

            in direct handling of the 'something', then in manipulating
            some small device with which the agent puts the something
            somewhere, *** without moving from a specific position ***.
            Perhaps the largest 'putting' would be moving earth with a
            steam shovel while seated in the control cab, but moving
            pallets with a forklift would be a TransportationEvent, since the

      <owl:Class rdf:ID="Getting">
        <rdfs:comment>The Event in which an Agent takes control of somethjing,
        physical or abstract. This is interpreted somewhat differently form in 
        SUMO, and is classified as a synonym of 'GainingControl'
          The taking control need not
        involve another agent losing control - something can
        be taken from a natural setting, or omsething abandoned may be
        taken up by anotehr person.  Also, this does not imply any
        change of ownership, it is purely the Event of an Agent
        gaining control of something.
        
        In SUMO this term is a ChangeOfPossession, but in COSMO it is not necessarily so, it
        is a supertype.
        SUMO: The subclass of ChangeOfPossession where the

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="TransferOfControl">
        <rdfs:comment>A collection of events and a specialization of
            #$GainingControl and #$LosingControlOfAControlledActor. Each
            instance of this collection is an event in which an object
            which is under the control of some agent has that control
            transferred to another agent different from the first.
            'Control' here means the ability on the part of an
            agent to determine 'what happens to' another
            object or agent.  In the case where the thing controlled
            exhibits 'activities' or 'behavior',
            this extends to a nontrivial ability to direct or
            circumscribe some important aspect of the behavior that the
            object or agent exhibits.  An agent with independent goals
            and purposes that is under 'control' is not able
            to freely pursue those goals and purposes: i.e., the
            'controller' is able to exert some kind of
            significant and immediate check upon the
            'controlled' agent's capacity to pursue its
            goals at whim.  Every #$TransferOfControl presupposes
            exactly one #$Agent who #$takesControl of the thing being
            transferred, exactly one #$Agent who #$losesControl of the
            thing being transferred, and one thing that is the
            #$objectOfControlTransfer, i.e., the object of the transfer
            of control.  In some cases, e.g., #$CapturingAnimal or
            #$TakingAPersonPrisoner, the agent who #$losesControl
            coincides with the thing that is the
            #$objectOfControlTransfer.  You cannot have a
            #$TransferOfControl without someone or something that
            #$losesControl, however.  E.g., finding and taking an
            (unclaimed) penny in the street is merely a
            #$GainingControl.  A given #$TransferOfControl is not
            necessarily #$doneBy the agent who #$takesControl or by the
            agent who #$losesControl:  it could conceivably be
            instigated by a third party independent of either of these.</rdfs:comment>

        COSMO note: This category is interpreted as

        It may merely be a connector, such as  a
        WallOutlet, or may be the power generator itself,

        terminals to which electrical devices can be

        NOTE also that in Cyc there is a 
        distinction between 'VoltageSource' and
        'CurrentSource'.  Apparently, a
        'CurrentSource' is suppopsed to be the unit that actually
        generates the power, but Cyc has 'PowerSupply' as
        a subtype, and the PowerSupply in typical devices
        does not generate power, rather it converts
        line power to another voltage.  In COSMO
        'CurrentSource' is renamed as 'PowerGenerator'</rdfs:comment>

          generic, and can be applied to mechanical power or
          electrical power.
          
          In reality, every device consumes some power,
          though it may be quite small and not required for
          functioning.  In mechanical devices, friction
          causes power loss in transmission, and in electrical
          devices, resistance causes power loss.  But for
          devices that are instances of this category, the
          losses, though unavoidable, are incidental to the power
          generation on one end and power consumption on the other end.

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="Quality">
        <rdfs:comment>A BFO and DOLCE category appearing to be functionally
        equivalent to the COSMO 'AttributeType', and perhaps 'AttributeValue',
        but perhaps differing  as described below.  This 'synonym' is one case where the 'synonym'
        may serve as a placeholder for a related but different category not
        yet used in reasoning.
        BFO  rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource='#spatio-temporal-particular'
        
        There is a true difference of Quality and AttributeValue,
        in that in DOLCE a 'Quality' is a Trope,
        whereas in COSMO an 'AttributeValue' is a DOLCE Quality Region.  Because
        Tropes are not yet (v0.35) used in COSMO, this category is a placeholder
        for possible future supplementation.
        
        DOLCE: Quality: Qualities can be seen as the basic entities we can  perceive
         or measure: shapes, colors, sizes, sounds, smells, as well as weights, lengths,
         electrical charges... 'Quality' is often used as a synonym of 'property', 
         but this is  not the case in this upper ontology: qualities are particulars,
         properties are universals.  Qualities inhere to entities: every entity 
         (including qualities themselves) comes with  certain qualities, which exist 
         as long as the entity exists.

        In DOLCE, qualities are tropes that are considered to inhere in the objects 
         that possess the quality; they are individuals and therefore cannot have subclasses;
         therefore each instance of 'quality' is a spatio-temporal-particular.
         Each quality is located in some quality region by the relation 'has-quale'. 
         A 'quale' may be the location for many qualiies.  DOLCE definition of quale: 
         'An atomic region',

        The DOLCE 'qualities' will seldom need be used in reasoning, as the 
        tropes have few relations with other entities.
        The interesting entities will be the quales, or AttributeValues.

         COSMO note: Examples of qualities would be the redness of a particular rose,
          or the shape of a particular ball.</rdfs:comment>

    of a characteristic  spatial shape inhering in some arrangement of 
    other continuant entities.   Sites are characteristically entities
    at or in which other continuant entities can be located.

    NOTE: in COSMO, human roles such as 'Student' can inherit from both
    'Person' - an Independent Continuant - and 'Role' - a dependent continuant,
    so dependence and independence in COSMO are not disjoint categories,
    rather different ways of viewing the same object.  This persective
    differs significantly from the usage in BFO.

    <rdfs:comment>Definition: An independent continuant that is a mereological 
      sum of separate objects and possesses non-connected boundaries.
      
      Examples: a heap of stones, a group of commuters on the subway, 
        a collection of random bacteria, a flock of geese, the patients in a hospital.
     
        NOTE: in COSMO, Group is restricted to groupings of at least
        one entity, as in OpenCyc.  In this manner PluralThing stays closer to the 
        linguistic intuition of a plural.  A more generic Group that is not a 
        TemporalThing could be defined, but is left out at this point.
        
        NOTE: The BFO 'ObjectAggregate' is somewhat similar to a 
        COSMO 'PluralThing'; but in BFO the requirements are more stringent
        than for COSMO 'Group', since a COSMO 'Group' can be composed of arbitarily
        defined components, whereas in BFO each 'Object' of the aggregate
        must be an object with perceptible boundaries. Since BFO 'Object' 
        is disjoint from 'fiat object part' and from ObjectAggregate,
        we need to make 'ObjectAggregate' a subtype of 'PluralThing',
        and to specify that each component of an 'ObjectAggregate' is a 
        'WholeObject'.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>Definition: An independent continuant that is a lower dimensional 
      part of a spatial entity, normally a closed two-dimensional surface.
      Boundaries are those privileged parts of objects that exist at exactly 
      the point where the object is separated off from the rest of the existing 
      entities in the world.
      
      Examples: the surface of the skin, the surface of the earth, 
       the surface of the interior of the stomach, the outer surface of a cell 
       or cell wall.
       
       COSMO note: The BFO documentation makes this sound like a very

    <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: this BFO Type was shifted from IndependentContinuant to
    a Role in COSMO, becasue a Site is a Site of something, i.e. depends on
    something, and the disjoints caused clashes.
    
     BFO Definition: An independent continuant that is the sum of an 
      independent continuant or entities and a spatial region or spatial regions.
      
      BFO Examples: the front lawn of our building, a nasal cavity, a blood vein, 
       an environment, sinuses, canals, ventricles, the lumen of the gastrointestinal 
       tract, the interior of the aorta, the room in which one is located.
       
      COSMO NOTE: in BFO this category is disjoint with Object, but not
      in COSMO.  In COSMO, it has more of the character of a Role that can merge with an Object
       to form an Object that performs a Role, which is conceptually similar
       to the BFO description as a sum of an IndependentContinuant and
       a spatial region.
       
      As a Role, a Site can be a 'site' of some activity, but it only plays that
      Role for some interval of time, 0utside of which it is not necessarily a
      Role anymore.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>The BFO Type that corresponds most closely to
    COSMO 'SituationProcessEventOrState'.
    
    BFO Definition: An occurrent that exists in time by occurring or happening,
      has temporal parts and always involves and depends on some SNAP entity.
    
      Examples: the life of an organism, the process of meiosis, the course of a disease,
      the flight of a bird.
      
   ***** Special COSMO NOTE on BFO 'ProcessualEntity' *****************************
   In BFO the Type 'ProcessualEntity' appears to be most closely similar to
     COSMO 'SituationProcessEventOrState'.  However, the division of the BFO
     Type into 'FiatProcessPart' and 'Process' has no corresponding 
     division in Cyc or SUMO.  In COSMO we include a FiatProcessPart for
     compatibility, but do not use it (no subtypes), and do not use the BFO partition
     of 'ProcessualEntity'.  (included in this note below)

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="ProcessualContext">
    <rdfs:comment>A BFO Type that appears to view an Event as a context.  In COSMO, 
    events are classified as a subtype of Context, which should serve the
    same purpose.
    
    **BUT** in BFO a 'ProcessualContext' is disjoint from a Process (i,e, Event), so 
     they cannot be identical.  Some form of 'representation' relation will probably
     be required to reconcile the 'context' view with the 'event' itself.
    
    BDO Definition: An Occurrent entity consisting of a characteristic spatial 
    shape inhering in some arrangement of other occurrent entities. Processual contexts
    are characteristically entities at or in which other occurrent entities can be located or occur.
    
    BFO: Examples: a surgical operation as processual context for a nosocomical infection,
    a routine check-up as processual context for the finding of a tumor, a clinical trial
    as processual context for the discovery of a new treatment or drug</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>COSMO: this BFO Type is interpreted as an Event, but 
     one that is specifically represented as not a complete Event
     (i.e. not a 'Process' in BFO).  It is unclear
     under what circumstances designating an Event as 'Fiat' will be useful, but this
     is included for compatibility.
    
    BFO Definition: A processual entity that is part of a process 
      but that does not have bona fide beginnings and endings corresponding
      to real discontinuities.
      
      Examples: chewing during a meal, the middle part of a rainstorm, 
       the worst part of a heart-attack, the most interesting part
       of Van Gogh's life.
       
     COSMO note:  In real physical Events, the precise boundaries can be fuzzy, but
       most Events of interest will have conceptually fairly well-defined beginnings
       and ends (periods duting which the fluents (attributes)  of interest are static),
       even if those beginnings and ends stretch out over some
       period of time.  We anticipate that most Events will be classified
       under 'Event' as subtypes of the BFO 'Pocess' which is intended to
       *not* be a Fiat Process (event).  Thus this category may rarely if
       ever be used for classification.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>COSMO note: this Type was renamed from the BFO 'Volume',
    but is used in COSMO as any three-dimensional volume, which sould be
    in an abstract mathematical space, and one subtype of which is a volumen in
       the space of our real world, whic is what the BFO 'Volume' represents.
       On COSMO a volume of space in our real world is a 'PhysicalSpaceRegion'.
       
       BFO: 'Volume' in BFO is some specific three-dimensional
       region of our empirical real universe.  **NOTE** that these three-dimensional
       regions are in each case defined relative to some physical object,
       whether it be the body of an animal ('BodyCavity'), some region near the
       surface of the Earth ('GeographicalArea'), or relative to some
       outer space object such as the sun, a planet, or another galaxy.
       It is possible to imagine an 'absolute' coordinate as the center of
       mass of the universe, with coordinate vectors relative to the 
       directions of distant galaxies, but it is unlikely such a coordinate
       system will be useful.  NOTE also that this is pure sapce, not the
       contents of the space - it is not a PhysicalObject, not a part
       of any PhysicalObject, and no PhysicalObject is part  of it, though it
       may *contain* PhysicalObjects.
    
      BFO Definition: A spatial region with three dimensions.
    
      BFO Examples: a cube, the inside of a skull, the space occupied
       by a pulmonary artery</rdfs:comment>
